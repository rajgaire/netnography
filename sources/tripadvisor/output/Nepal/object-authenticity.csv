This was the palace of the Malla kings of Patan, originally built in 1734 AD by displacing Ha Bāhā, though it has been rebuilt several times since (it was leveled in the massive 1934 AD earthquake, for example). The collection continues to expand, too, as (sadly) other historic structures of Patan are rebuilt without preserving their centuries-old carvings but at least letting the museum display them. There are occasional dances and musical events in the courtyard, and the impressively re-established annual Tantric-inspired Kartik Naach is performed in the fall outside the museum. Guide not necessary but many people apparently miss the second, separate entrance and even fewer visit the pond behind the palace."

The Sun Dhoka was topped by a beautiful , golden pediment . At the apex of the pediment was a huge Kirtimukha holding his two long fangs with his two hands coming out through his majestic mane . Below the Kirtimukh was the family of Lord Panchmukhi Shiv with his console Parvati and sons Ganesh and Skand . This family was flanked by Makar torana , ( floral-reptile motifs )with two celestial makars depicted as one third terrestrial animal ( trunk of elephant ) in the frontal part , one third aquatic animal ( crocodile ) in the middle part , one third bird ( tail of peacock ) in the hind portion with extended floral tail .  There was a golden window above the Dhoka ( gate ) , once used by the king to make public appearances .The window enshrined Avlokiteshwara aka Karunamaya ( now known all over the world as Machchhendranath , a famous Hindu yogi ) surrounded by the pantheon of Hindu gods .  The old museum building was reinforced with concealed RCC beams & slabs and retrofitted with moisture resistant membranes to protect the walls and roof from dampness .  We first witnessed Shilapatras inscripted from 659 Ad to 1896 AD . Then we climbed new stair case in the eastern wing .  There we saw a ritual oil lamp with bronze donor figure made at Bhaktapur in 1870 AD and placed under terracotta nitche and torana .  Then we saw five Buddhist beautiful figurines showcased together :  The left hand side bottom most figure was of Chamunda / Kali / Mahalaxmi . It was made of Brass in 18th - 19th century in Nepal . Depicted as a skeletal crone as no other Goddess was , the fierce Mahalaxmi - also called Chamunda / Kali - could not be mistaken for any other female deity .  The left hand side top most figure was of Indra . It was made of Gilt copper in 17th - 18th century in Nepal . Indra , an ancient Hindu God reverred by all Nepalese was recognised by his horizontal third eye , in contrast to the vertical third eye of other deities . The right hand side bottom most figure was of Vajradaka . It was made of Bronze in 17th - 18th century in Nepal . The upturned face with gaping mouth identified Vajradaka , an earth spirit who devours ill influences . Tibetans sometime took medicine through his mouth .  The right hand side top most figure was of Yam . It was made of Bronze in 17th - 18th century in Nepal . Yam , a fierce Buddhist protector , "" King of Religious Law "" , and the personification of death was unmistakable because of his bull head and mount , the water buffalo , a combination shared with no other deity .  At the centre was White Tara of the Seven Eyes . This idol was made of Cold gold , Copper alloy , Gilt , Paint and Semi precius stones in 18th - 19th century in Tibet . This form of the Buddhist Goddess Tara was reognised by her five extra eyes , one on the forehead andtwo each on the palms and soles .  The tantric images of Buddhism , the deities are in sexual embrace . We appreciated two such images :  One such image of Yam and His Consort .This idol is made of Cold gold , Copper alloy , Gilt , Paint and Semi precious stones in 15th century in Tibet . Yam , "" Lord of Death "" and "" King of the Law "" united with his consort in the vigorous pose of the fierce deities . Both wear skull studded crowns , his was a garland of severed human heads ; hers was a girdle of humane bone . They were supported by Yam's mount the water buffalo . Originally a Hindu deity , Yam was eventually incorporated into the Buddhist pantheon as a protector .  Another image was of Chakrasamvara and Vajravarahi . This idol was made of Bronze and Gilt in 18th - 19th century in Nepal . When the esoteric Bodhisattva Chakrasamvara united with his consort Vajravarahi , the "" Dimand Sow "" , they represented the union of wisdom and compassion that is the actuality of enlightenment . This extreme multiheaded and multiaremed representation was characteristic of Tantric imagery .  We also learnt the Lost Wax casting process depicted detail by various photographs having commentary .  The visit to the museum is a MUST to know the cultural richness of Nepalese civilization .  Entry Fee : Included in Patan Darbar Square Entry Fee Timings : 10:30 to 16:30 Closed : Tuesdays"

And though I haven't gone inside the Kathmandu and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares, I would have to say that I'm impressed by this place and especially its museum.  You pay Rs 1000, which is quite a big amount, but the proceeds go to the rehabilitation of the place. I appreciated that when I went to the Patan Museum and learned about the history of the Durbar Square, the rehabilitation efforts that they have put into it, and the future plans for the place.  There were also a few galleries to check out that was very informative about the Hindu and Buddhist history, symbolisms, gods, goddesses, and beliefs.  You can get lost within the area for more than 2 hours, just reading through the descriptions in the museum and learning more about the Nepalese culture.  I recommend it! The museum really is a big plus."

It is about 40 minutes from central Kathmandu and there is an entrance fee to the main area. Patan is in Lalitpur district which is said to have been founded in the third century BC by the Kirat dynasty and later expanded by Licchavis in the 6th century. It was expanded further by the Mallas during the medieval period. Patan Durbar Square is listed by UNESCO as one of seven Monument Zones that make up the Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Site. Some Patan monuments were badly damaged in the 2015 earthquakes and work is continuing on rebuilding. But the Museum is outstanding and well worth a visit with excellent displays giving the history of Nepal. There are magnificent displays and the signage is in both English and Nepali. Lalitpur has the highest number of renowned artists and finest craftsmen ever recorded in the history of Nepali art. You can only marvel at the intricate wood and metal work as you move through the museum and admire the workmanship of the craftspeople. After visiting the Museum make sure you walk down the road to the Golden Temple - it was spared by the quakes. You can easily spend half a day at Patan and there are many cafes for lunch or tea. Well worth a visit and the entrance fee.

Didn't really know what to expect and found surprising delights at every turn. In the main palace, the upstairs galleries gave us much more insight into the spiritual and artistic heritage of Himalayan culture than looking at temples from the outside. The written descriptions of each item are as thoughtful and informative as any we've ever seen.  At first we thought the main building was the entire museum, but then stumbled into the equally wonderful separate courtyard with its own upstairs architectural gallery exhibiting woodwork etc. Magnificent."

It is a UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites. The Patan Museum was inaugurated in 1997 by Late King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah. The Patan Museum displays the traditional sacred art of Nepal in an illustrious architectural setting. Its home is an old residential court of Patan Darbar, one of the royal palaces of the former Malla kings of the Kathmandu Valley. Its gilded door and window face one of the most beautiful squares in the world. The residential palace compound of Keshav Narayan Chowk which houses the museum dates from 1734, displacing a Buddhist monastery that is still remembered in an annual public rite on the palace doorstep. But both monastery and palace rest on far older foundations that may go back to the Licchavi Period (ca. 3rd to 9th century). The garden to the rear of the museum has been adapted to incorporate a pleasant resting place and The Patan Museum Cafe run by the Summit Hotel, Kathmandu."

Most objects are fine metalwork depictions of deities, and insights into the metalwork craft - for which Patan was once famous. Photos can be taken inside.

The artefacts are sympathetically displayed with very good labelling, as are the temporary exhibitions too. The main galleries in this once royal palace, once monastery, follow and explain the the origins, development and symbolism of Hinduism and Buddhism. Other galleries show exhibits which explain the metal technology involved in creating many Buddhist and Hindu effigies. In addition, at the moment (November 2016) and temporarily there are two excellent photographic exhibitions. One contains pictures of an annual traditional Hindu ceremony covering the last thirty years. The other, more powerful, exhibition shows in visual form the struggles of the Dalit people (the so-called 'Untouchables') to gain respect and civil rights. This is a lovely museum but if museums don't have much appeal per se, it is still worth visiting just to see the building itself which is exceptionally fine for its architecture and intricate wooden carvings, or to sit in the tranquil garden and have something to eat or drink at the cafe there."

It's an experience not to be missed as the Royal Palace is a joy to explore, but older visitors beware - unfortunately access is by a series of steep ladders between floors only which excludes anyone with frailties or disabilities. The series of courtyards at ground level are wonderful to experience as long as the visitor is capable of stepping over high stone entrances. the Museum Cafe is a delight - a cool, shady oasis from the heat with top food and beverages. The Lonely Planet guidebook recommends taking time out here between tackling different floors of the museum and I agree. A fabulous dip into Nepal's past."

I found this place a quiet venue to understand and view together at a glance both religions’ features and contributions to the history of this Country (and not only); a contribution to mutual understanding as well, especially in the view of the fact that Buddhism has basically left India (and in Nepal too it is far behind Hinduism in terms of followers, and it is mostly alive thank to Tibetan influence)."

At Patan Museum all of the information is in English and is very detailed. The museum focuses on the history of Hinduism and Buddhism in Patan and has lots of interesting statues. There is two parts to the museum both included in the ticket price of 400 rupees. While the main museum through the golden door is intact the second half through a neighbouring door off the main square has had some damage from the earthquake but this doesn't seem to have had much in it anyway. Definitely make a visit here.  Tip: I paid 1000 rupees for a guide as I wandered into patan square, and apart from showing me where the golden temple is he wasn't worth the price (though he was a nice person). Definitely don't get a guide for the museum as I saw one person being shown round quickly by the guide and he didn't see much of the exhibits. Do it at your own speed."

We don’t know the current status of the museum, but it’s such an underrated attraction we want to give it a shout-out on Trip Advisor, regardless.  The museum is housed in a wing of an old palace that that has been beautifully restored to create a thoroughly modern museum. The collection, mostly sculpture from the Kathmandu Valley, exceeds anything you can see in the western world.  The glory of the Patan Museum is its display. Not only is each individual object attractively displayed, the entire museum is intelligently organized around the goal of clarifying the numerous deities and religious inspirations that gave rise to Nepalese art. The helpful wall texts and labels are in fluent English.  We saw the Patan Museum in the course of a crowded schedule and didn’t have time to explore properly. A couple of hours would have been better."

So tourists need not go farther in terms of researching. They just need to spend under an hour to go through the whole exhibits. The fact that the displays are housed in one of the courtyards (used to be part of the King's palace), with the architecture intact, is quite a plus. One can also feast on different media used to interpret, say, the Buddha sculpture."

Also known as Lalitpur, these were the courts / the royal complex in Nepal. The area has a lot of anciant temples, court rooms, monestries, etc. The most prominant is the Living Goddess Patan Kumari's temple. A seven year old girl living as a goddess in the temple & the stories aroung this religious belief is amazing. it was worthwhile understanding the culture, beliefs, etc of the local residents to familarise yourself with the culture. I was amazed by what I saw & herd.... cannot describe as I believe words are too less.....

The exhibits are kept in excellent display cases with professional lighting. In my opinion this is definitely one of the best museums in Nepal.  There are panels showing how the metal is worked to make the exquisite metal idols that Patan is famous for.  There is a stiff entry fee (NPR 250 for SAARC nationals). BUT the museum is definitely worth it!!!!  Tip: Please spare a minute to climb up to the Bell Tower. You will get a Panoramic view of the Patan Durbar Square.

Everything comes in one package -- a crash course on religion and history, nice walk inside an old palace, and people watching from the windows.  It is a relatively small museum. We spent about 2 hours inside because of our schedule. This allows us to walk through all areas and get a general idea. If you are a big fan of reading all information in museums, you can easily spend a half day inside.

The vast majority of the items are bronze or copper. There is display on the metalworking techniques creating items thru either the lost wax or repousse methods. 4th floor has old pictures of the Patan area. You can also climb up to the bell tower and have a slightly better view fo the Square and get a very good view of the one column directly in front of you with the cobra head at the back.

Spread across two of the historic buildings of Patan's Durbar Square, the museum is a definite must-see. The first building houses the exhibition areas and some of the artefacts and figurines in bronze, gilt and gold are stunning. The museum's incorporation into the old building, an ex-palace and monastery, during renovation has been handled with great care and there is little externally to suggest what you will find along the maze of corridors and floors.  The second building has no exhibits as such but is, itself, the exhibit with incredible carvings and features in its stone and woodwork. To the rear, there is a sunken pool within a garden that is being renovated.  The museum café is very smart and reasonably-priced. There are two museum shops. The items on sale are good quality and their prices reflect that. Don't expect bargain hunting here.  Signs in English, located near the items on exhibition, provide good explanations about the history, etc. of each."

The museum has a great introduction to Nepalese Hinduism and Buddhism that will appeal to complete newbies as well as those who know something about either.  We took a taxi out in the morning and walked back into town. The taxi fare is negotiable but generally 100 rupees per kilometer ($1/km) should be the upper limit. Our driver was very interested in doing a deal for the entire day which we declined.

And the way the exhibits are presented makes it very easy for the visitor to get a sense of the achievements people of Patan were capable of attaining. A new wing has also opened. It's prized exhibit is the gold fountain head, stolen some years ago and now recovered. The original piece is part of the museum collection; the one you see in the sunken royal bathing fountain pool is an exact replica.

If you visit anything in Nepal - visit the Patan Museum!  There is a nice garden behind the museum where you can relax from the noise of the city, probably the most peaceful place anywhere in Patan. The coffee shop is beautiful but overpriced and the food is boring.

Once inside, the museum rooms are spread around two or three floors of the old palace complex. They overlook a central coutyard that had a small stupa in it. All the exhibitions were beautifully set-up and well illuminated. There were very informative placards for each exhibit, so one can learn a lot here. We spent at least two hours viewing the exhibitions. I'd also recommend the museum guidebook, which was beautifully photographed. The museum shops were also attractive, as was the very pleasant museum cafe. If you're in Patan, the museum is a must.

You can see by the architecture and building layout that the city was very wealthy during it's day. Even now the buildings have been restored to their original elegance. Of particular note is the Ancient Royal Palace that includes meticulous carvings and reflects the architecture of the ancient Newar peoples. There are a variety of temples to visit and explore throughout Patan while wandering along the side streets."

Damages from the earthquake have been almost completely restored, and the square offers a great museum with access to most of the palace. While it still has its share of merchants a guides who will solicit you, they're not too intrusive and theres much less of it than a lot of other sites. Garbage and graffiti are controlled better here, its less crowded, and the site offers many things to see. You can easily spend hours here. The entry fee is 1000 rupees but what you get for it makes it feel dignified.  If that weren't enough, the surrounding neighborhood of Lalitpur is very charming and offers a lot of old architecture mixed in with newer restaurants and bars, its a lovely area. I can strongly recommend spending a day in and around the Patan Durbar Square."

It is easy to come from Kathmandu which we did a day trip combined with Bhaktapur Durbar Square for a morning half day trip for about 6 hours (including 1 hour lunch) with a negotiated price arranged with taxi driver through our hotel - Bodhi Boutique Hotel at Thamel district. The taxi fare for the entire trip was NPR 2,500 for the entire 6 hours. After double checked with hotel staff for the rough guide of taxi fare, single trip from Thamel to Baktapur cost NPR 1,000 (45 mins journey) and single trip from Baktapur to Patan is NPR500-600 (35 mins journey) plus single trip from Patan to Kathmandu is NPR500 (20 mins journey). Hence, the additional NPR400-500 is for the waiting time, depending on negotiation with driver. Unlike Baktapur Durbar Square, there are many entry points to Patan Durbar Square since the square is not fully fenced. There will be many security personnels with uniforms walking around to identify foreign tourists and bring them to ticketing office to pay for the tickets that cost NPR 1,000 per person per entry. We thought it was a scam initially, but soon we discovered that it is how it works when visiting to Patan Durbar Square. Locals are allowed to enter the square free of charge. The entrance fee is inclusive of the museum right in front of the square with good introduction and information about Hinduism history and culture in Patan (Latlipur). There are some interesting collections of the Hindu and Buddhist Gods statues, such as Shiva, Krishna, etc. The Square was a typical Newar Achitecture with beautiful wooden carvings, Hindu idols, etc. One of the highlights is the ancient royal palace where Malla Kings of Latlipur resided. We also saw the local devotees carried out the prayer rituals which was an interesting cultural sights. It is one of the three Durbar Squares (including Kathmandu & Baktapur) in the Kathmandu Valleys which is the UNESCO World Heritage Site that is under the threat of earthquake especially the most destructive volcanic eruption in 2015. Restoration effort is ongoing to preserve these valuable historical and cultural site."

A traditional Newari city patan has a unique traditions as well as identity. As we were with my tour guide we were lucky to know most of the things that patan durbar square has. The Main durbar square is so unique with its wooden architecture as you see there so much wood work everywhere. The main house used to be the living place of the Malla Kings family in the past and there are many courtyard and Chowk inside. All of this Chowk has it’s own significance. Siddhi Narsingh Malla was the king who built many temples and part of durbar in 17th Century B.C. Krishna Temple was the another attraction over that squre which is built by the stone only in sikhara style which took 25 years to build by King Siddhi Narsingh Malla. The place also popular for buddhisim as there are a lot of sakya family and it has a lot of Boudha Bihar. Hiranya Barna Mahavihar is one of the popular. Overall our experience to patan was great with my guide Sabin as I learned many things. I tried the Newari food which was awesome but quite spicy. You must visit patan if you are coming to Nepal. Highly Recommended.

In the heart of old town we have a magnificent palace and 9 different temples.Collectively it is known as Patan Durbar Square.It reflects the skill and craftsmanship of the Malla period(1200 to 1768 A.D.). The natives,known as Newars have carved exquisite wooden windows and amazing stone temples and statues all around. The Keshav Narayan chowk(courtyard) has a museum that was set up by Smithsonian Institute.It is now partially damaged by 2015 earthquake but renovation is going on at full speed and everything should be ready in about a year. The inner garden has a delightful cafe as well. This part of the palace was renivated by the Austrian government(1983-1997). The Mul chowk(Central courtyard) and the private bath/ritual courtyard were done by US,UK,Nepalese and Japanese help. The Mul chowk has statues of the Ganges and Yamuna river with some fine wooden struts (with original colors) dating back to 17th century. The private bath complex is the oldest part of the palace dating back to 1610 A.D.It now has a gallery open with some frescoes.The inner garden area is a currently a workshop for woodcarvers (for renovation purpose) and it also has a lily pool with some stone figures. The main golden door leading to Keshav narayan chowk is flanked by two wooden benches where seniors sit and talk about nostalgia. Next to it is a water spout dating back to 570 A.D. and has two small resthouses. Bang infront of the golden gate is the stone temple of Krishna,the 1st Shikara style temple of the valley.

I must compliment the architectures especially the bathing pool of the Queen, it’s so beautifully crafted!  All in all, this is a place not to be missed if you visit Kathmandu :)"

Even better than Kathmandu's Durbar Square and even if the earthquake damaged some of the shrines and buildings the magic of this place is still intact. Very interesting also the visit to the inner courtyards and small museums (included in the entrance fee) hosted in the buildings on the right side of the square. Good info and detailed leaflet about other attractions located in Patan, not far from Durbar."

Basically I wanted to explore and run some rivers on my Kayak. But during my visit there, I was told to visit this place by a friend. Just how wonderful Patan Durbar square is for a traveller to experience some of the tradition & heritage structures of Nepal. the oldest of the three cities in the Kathmandu valley. The square is made up of 136 courtyards and 55 temples. It was destroyed by earthquake few years back and some places are still under maintenance & rebuilding stage. However all the structures are amazing, heritage Hindu kingdom. There are a number of historic temples & they include some extraordinary erotic carvings on one of the temples in a traditional South Asian style. The Patan Museum is also simply amazing. Also the Mahabuddha temple is an easy walk from here. You might get lucky to witness some religious processions and performances in the square as well. Supposedly these are fairly regular. So if you want to time your visit accordingly may be you can contact the tourist office before visiting. As I was alone and also less crowd during the morning visit, I got absorbed and felt so spiritual. There is so much ancient culture in this thriving and beautiful place.  This is a must visit place for all travellers to Nepal. I ticked off another beautiful destination on my unknown places bucket list :)  I bow down to this land and the people of this land who have built & preserved this gem of a place for the world to experience."

Most of the buildings are still under reconstruction but you can still admire the beauty of the Newari architecture.  We practically spent the whole day from mid morning until around six pm walking around the square and the side alleys of Lalitpur.  Try to avoid the evening as it is chaotic with all the cars, motorbikes and people walking around unless that is what you’re looking for.  The ticket gives you access to the museum which is a great way to learn about Buddhism and Hinduism through the sculptures, there is also a cafe inside. This was once part of the royal palace.  Avoid the museum shop which is extremely expensive and costs more than three times the prices of the shops around the town.  The square itself is very impressive with beautiful ancient buildings, a lot of buildings are still inaccessible due to the post earthquake reconstruction but the photo opportunities are constant.  The Newari architecture is phenomenal and the intricacy and detail of the arts and crafts is definitely something that is lacking within first world countries. The buildings in the adjacent streets and squares are stunning.  With incredible Stupas and shrines popping up in every corner and back street between houses and shops that have been there for centuries with most intact.  We encountered numerous Newari women working incessantly in the rebuilding of the area, carrying very heavy brick bags over their heads.  The streets are perfect for a shopping day with very impressive wood, metal and clay works available along with Mandala and Thaka art. Costing upwards of 1500 rupees for a student painting.  Barter for prices and compare one shop to another as some are double the price of others.  The roads are a bit crazy with motorcycles and cars passing all the time in tiny streets. But we felt very safe walking around and no one bothered us at all.  All in all an excellent walking adventure around Lalitpur and Patan Durbar Square."

It was small but one can only imagine the beauty and grandeur before the earthquake. We spent some time in the museum appreciating the centuries old religious statues. An unexpected plus point was buying a beautiful Thangka painted by a master from the Tibeyan Thangka Buddhist Painting School and managed bargained it down to the price we had in mind. Spent an hour there learning how to differentiate between a student, professional and master painted Thanka, which was really educational and makes you appreciate the time and detailed work that goes into one. Now we have a beautiful momento to remind us of Nepal."

For a mom traveling with a teenage daughter to a new country, they were more than helpful. They communicated well in advance of the trip and answered any questions I had.

The location, Hattiban, was perfect - surrounded by forest and nature but a bit luxurious too. I thought the retreat was great value for the price, as it included all food, coffee/tea/snacks, accommodation, 6-7 hours of yoga (and a bit of meditation) with a fantastic, experienced teacher, transportation and sauna.

As a chef and a person with a knowledge of the food industry I can honestly say that this was one of the worst dining experiences of my life.  I'll try be brief as I know how essay reviews are to read but seriously what I endured deserve one.  Yer well lovely looking place, nice sounding menu on the mid price range with some really tasty sounding options. Great. Lovely courtyard, perfect.  So my partner ordered the lasagna and I the Chinese inspired mushroom and pak choy. We had a great feeling as a place with great reviews and such a well presented location deserves high expectations. The lasagna came out only slightly warm and the middle still cold and as you can see from the photo not a lot of love to gratinate the cheese on top, a basic for any lasagna. We asked for it to me warmed and knowing a microwave would be the answer and sure enough after 2mins we received it warm of course but as expected the microwaved cheese leaking oil!!! Tasty!  My dish was actually very tasty exept for the 3rd bite including a rock. Okay, this for me is seriously unexectable, it is in no way a mistake, it tell me that the kitchen doesn't wash their pak choy!! This can pass for a street food dish but not a restaurant of this standard.  I called the waiter over, he took the dish away and then brought me the menu.... I of course asked for the manager. To be honest she handled the situation fairly well, after I suggested her to offer me a new complementary dish. The BLT that I ordered was tasty but really nothing special. Besides the fact that after the first bite she came running over to ask if ""I loved the new dish."" Seeing the waiters and the manager in the reflection standing around the cash register and looking over in my direction and laughing didn't help the already broken trust.  Wouldn't return and if I were you don't bother. Stick to a street side samosa."

The staff were slow and unable to keep track of whether or not a table had already had been helped. I waited for a bit before a staff member came to my table to see if I ordered food; I had not, I hadn't even seen a menu yet. Fast forward to getting my menu and deciding which dish I wanted and it was the same process again. After a while someone asked if I had ordered which I was finally able to do.  I ordered a lamb curry/dhal bat specialty of theirs which unfortunately was average at best. The rice was dry and had the texture and taste of being old. The lamb was hard in spots and generally not tender. The lentils and chili were both forgettable.

As the name of the cafe says, located right at Patan Dhoka--an arched 'Gate' in the historical wall around the old city kingdom of Patan--and under the watchful and creative eyes of an equally historic family of priests and scholars, Dhokaima is the most public meeting point in this beautifully restored compound, which includes not only the cafe, but, as well, three influential scholarly organizations. The oldest of these--Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya--has been preserving and promoting resources in the Nepali language for some sixty years (http://madanpuraskar.org/) and hosts related public events and exhibitions to showcase the collections. The Himal Association, begun as the original Himal magazine in 1987, expanded so much that it outgrew its Patan Dhoka quarters and moved to Lazimpat but it remains still very much a presence, especially in the excellent bookstore adjacent to the cafe. Last, but far from least, is the Social Science Baha, which, with its library, lectures, fellowships, and conferences (including those coordinated with the U.S.-based Association for Nepal and Himalayan Studies), makes the Dokhaima compound a pivotal place for both local and foreign Nepali-centric scholars."

But inside the walls, the bamboo and umbrellas are so soothing...  The absolute best thing here are the Mojitos. Made with fresh mint grown on the grounds and often picked AFTER you order! What could be fresher than that! I love the Mojitos so much that after an absence of 11 months, the bartender immediately recognized me upon my return.  The momos (veg and chicken) are also quite good with some nice spicy, flavorful dipping sauces. And I love the spring rolls. The chicken tandoori sandwich with mango chutney is a bargain. The spinach pasta is bland, but fine.  And the banana and apple/mango spring roll dessert with ice cream is quite good as well.  The prices are a little higher than some other places, but the food is much better than the typical tourist restaurant in Patan Durbar Square. I would highly recommend anyone visiting the area stop by here before or after for lunch or dinner.  Any taxi driver can find it, just ask to be taken to Patan Dhoka (Gate). The cafe is right next to the old Patan city gate. And there are always taxis outside in the square if you need a ride afterwards (even at night).  Enjoy!"

When she eventually did let us try our card, she swiped it and typed in R5,555.55 instead of R555 and pressed enter to put it through. I pressed cancel to no avail, so pulled the cord out of the wall to make sure we weren’t charged and we left without paying.

I was lulled back over and over by the soups: potato and carrot, zucchini and carrot, cream of tomato…all served with a slice of brown bread that was some of the best brown bread I had in the entire country. Plus it was the first café I came to trust with fresh salad, i.e. organic greens, sundried tomatoes, black and green olives, and a light dressing. Nearly every day if not every other day, I came in and sat at what I deemed “the Chef’s table”, i.e. one of the barstools in the front entry way. The guys that work there are so sweet and if you’re traveling alone, strike up a conversation. These guys (3 of which are in their early 20s) are pretty outstanding in making your wishes come true. One day I wanted a mulled wine (hot wine) and boom – they served one up though it wasn’t on the menu. Another day I really was craving avocado and shazam…an avocado salad with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. It’s a shame that their online presence isn’t more prevalent for the foreigners who search the internet for recommendations because I’d go here any day of the week, (probably every day of the week) if this was a restaurant near my home. And I can guarantee you that if they ever come out with a cook book for soups, I’m the first one to buy in. They put places like Panera, Pret, Eat, etc to shame. Oh and by the way, I had the ham and cheese sandwich twice (yum – real cheese!), the spaghetti Bolognese (fantastic meat sauce), the pepper steak (ok this was alright – not my favorite piece of beef in Nepal – that was in Pokhara, but still good), and they make the best crispy French fries I had locally. And if it helps two big tips: 1. They are open every day 7am-10pm and 2. It’s a bit harder to find as it seems no one ever knows places that are even within a block of them…it’s very close to Café Pagoda in Durbar Sq, Coffee, Tea and Me, and Newa Chen B&B. Sometimes people know Swotha kiosk, but I found that every time I asked about Swotha Sq, not a single local knew what I was talking about. Guys – thanks for making me feel at home, always having a seat available for me, and keeping me company."

This is THE place to eat in Patan as far as I'm concerned,and I tried a few, as I'm a bit of a foody.

There was a sign board guiding the tourists to enter Hiranya Varna Mahavihar aka Golden Temple guarded by two huge , life size stone lions ( one male another female ) . The temple got this name because of the gold plated pagoda type roof , beautiful golden facade and other golden edifices that adorn the mahavihar . We went there so early to listen to the listened to the sounds of chanting of prayers , revolving prayer wheels , ringing bells , etc .We sat there experiencing divine vibrations for an hour .

A guide accompanied us around the temple explaining the history and significance of the temple and many figurines , statues and paintings adorning the walls of the temple ,  This three-storey golden pagoda of Shakyamuni Buddha was built in the twelfth century by King Bhaskar Varman .At the entrance , we were confronted by two large brass elephants with riders , as the guardians .The brass and silver doorway was topped by a gorgeous repousse bass relief of the Buddha sitting in the Bhumisparsha mudra flanked by his two disciples , Sariputra and Mudgalayana . Afterwards there was a shrine adorned with a silver and golden chaitya .Behind it , there was a main shrine of Buddha .  Inside the shrine there was the bejewelled Buddha having an elaborate crown on his head . A huge Prabhamandal was intricately carved in gold on his entire body . Outside the shrine a beautifully carved panel showed various life scenes of the Buddha .  The design of the complex represents all the three main vehicles or Yanas of Buddhism . The main shrine represents the basic exoteric Shravakayana , the large Tibetan style image of Amoghapasha Lokeshwara on the first floor is the main Mahayanic deity . On the first floor , the principle Vajrayanic deity of the Kwa Bahah - Yogambara with three faces , black , white and red , and three eyes (each) was locked in a passionate embrace with his consort , Jnana Dakini . His first two hands held a vajra and bell . The remaining right hands caressed the breast of the consort and held an arrow. The left hands held a skullcup and a bowl . A jewel , crescent moon and vishvavajra adorn the black hair as an ornament , with a garland of five skulls and the five Buddhas as a crown , having the six mudras , wearing a tiger skin . Seated in the sattvasana , in the lap was the mother Jnana Dakini , white , with one face and two hands . The right hand held a katvanga staff and the left a skullcup - embracing the father adorned with the five mudras .  The Kwa Bahah is the repository of yet another famous text , the gold lettered Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparampita - a key Mahayan text written in India in first century AD .

A local visitor talked with me about something that was going on at the time. Evidently, a young boy is like an important priest or something to that effect here, and it was time for him to come out for his lunchtime prayers or something like that. Not that this was any spectacular ritual to watch but I was glad to catch a glimpse of a local tradition at the temple. Be sure to go out back behind the temple as there are a few historical Buddhist sitters there."

It got this name because of the beautiful golden facade and other golden edifices that adorn the monastery. This significant site is believed to have been built in the 12th century by King Bhaskar Verma; however, some say that it was created in its present form in 1409. At the entrance, you will be greeted by two large brass elephants and riders, standing as the guardians. Straight ahead from here is a shrine adorned with a silver and golden chaitya and behind it is the main shrine where a statue of Buddha is placed. The entire courtyard is also decorated with various effigies. You should take a closer look at these statues as the detailing is very fine.  A separate fee has to be paid for entering this temple. Cost of entering the Durbar Square is exclusive of this because technically, the premises actually falls out of the square area. The Golden Temple is actually a monastery, so like in every other Buddhist shrine, you are expected to remain silent or talk in very low tones. Secondly, photography is not allowed inside the shrine and you can take pictures only in the courtyard area."

To tourists it is more often known as The Golden Temple.  This Buddhist temple complex is believed to have been constructed in the twelth century by a ruler called Bhaskara Dev Varma. He was born a Hindu but became a great devotee of Lord Shakyamuni Buddha. Over the entrance doorway there are two wooden struts carved with the two most important Hindu gods, Shiva and Vishnu, who guard this Buddhist temple. It is one of the distinctive features of Hiranya Varna Mahavihar that many strict and elaborate rituals are maintained here which have been abandoned or were never performed in other such monastery temples.  The principal priest of this monastery is a young boy who must on no account be over twelve years old. With the assistance of an older boy or young man, he carries out the regular liturgical service in the shrine of the main Buddha. Both priests must be members of the monastery and they serve for a period of one month, during which time they must stay inside the courtyard. The only exception to this is that twice a day the younger priest circulates the area where most of the monastery members live ringing a bell, at the end of the morning service and before the evening service.  The main temple in the courtyard is a three-tiered rectangular pagoda structure dominating the entire complex. Its roofs and screened windows, including cornices and struts, are all gilded with gold. The temple banners that hang down from the roof to the level of the doorway are remarkable. A legend links them with the Buddha, who used them as a ladder to come down from heaven to earth."

There were no guided alternate roads so we had to literally walk muddy narrow passage. The temple area was small and clean. Well maintained. But I couldn't find depth in anything. So much I wanted to learn but not by reading or listening but by experiencing. I felt, everything I read and told were just passed as tales and nothing more. It was early morning and I could see devotees - male and females flocking the temple. Is it a good idea to throw rice grains and metal coins on century old monuments? For me, the place is overrated.

We felt a strong need for food other than curries, and tapas sounded good. And they were GREAT. The albondigas (tiny meatballs) and potatas bravas (roasted potatos with an excellent piquant sauce) were exceptional. As were the Serrano ham with tomato and the smoky eggplant. We ended up ordering doubles of several things. Oh - the chicken pincho was really good, too. At the end of this delightful and stress free meal (all things catered to the traveler's need for fresh fruits and veggies washed in iodine), I found to my horror and embarrassment that I had left all my money back at the hotel. I arranged a plan to leave my son as ""hostage"" (don't worry - he's 20) while I taxied back to hotel, then back to restaurant to pay, then back to hotel. The manager stepped in and acted with such kindness and grace, assuring me that he could work this out with my hotel and I was not to worry. Sure enough, a plan was hatched and carried out without us having to do all that running around! So, not only delicious food, but true hospitality was available. It was a wonderful way to end our trip abroad."

The menu is really impressive and looks more like a picture book for a coffee table. I really think it is the nicest menu I have ever seen and it explains the dishes. This is unique and so is the food.  We chose the platters which you can try a variety of the dishes (I do recommend this). Although one of the soups (?) was really terrible but only because it didn't suit our taste buds…it reminded me of sewage unfortunately and was a concoction of several types of beans. Otherwise, the other dishes I thought were impressing and many flavours I have never tried before.  The service didn't get any better and unfortunately I didn't bring mosquito spray and scored many bites, so we had to go inside to ask for the bill which took about 15 minutes more to produce the small piece of paper.

But it was a bunch of friends, and I was swept away in the tides of peer pressure.  Surely, I thought, now they've taken the last year to tighten up their service so food comes out at the same time -- or that food comes out, period! Surely, their waiters will be more present. Surely, their bar service will be more on point.  Oh well.  It was a Saturday night, moderately busy, but plenty of waitstaff in front of house. Got seated promptly with menus, but that was the last I saw of anything resembling decent service.  I got excited about wine list. No one came to take an order, so after 15 minutes or so, I walked around the dining room until I could coax a waiter over to the table. I ordered some wine and food.  Twenty minutes later, no drinks yet. Used the bathroom. A stark contrast to the elegant open air dining room, the WC had all the ambience of a truck stop.  Another 10 minutes pass. A waiter comes to tell me (a different waiter, every time) about how they don't have that wine. Or that other wine I wanted. Or the other one. I ask him to tell me about the wines they *do* have. A few high end imports, well beyond what I originally intended to spend. Order their lackluster house wine instead (the one my corner bodega sells for 1/4 of the price). At least they had that. No one else at this point had received drinks either, not even water.  At last, my food arrived. All of it at once, app and main. One full hour later (seriously) my friend's food arrives. Some late joiners received their food much later still.  As for the quality of the food, I just don't get it, people! I mean, yes, we live in Kathmandu, not NYC or Paris or Singapore. I do get that. Managed expectations and all that. But the wings were non-offensive at best, and the pizza? Meh. The thin crust was soggy and bland, the ingredients tasted previously frozen. There is better pizza to be had in this town, three minutes walking to Roadhouse, to be specific. Not sure why so many reviewers are backflipping about Vesper food.  The final spectacle: separate checks. Holy cow. You'd think we'd asked for their firstborn child. So much resentment. But c'mon, people come to your restaurant precisely because you can support medium to large parties. Why you hating?  That's fine. I won't return anywhere I'm not wanted. At least not for another year."

As soon as we walked in we were seated in the courtyard and given a menu to order food and beverages. Coming from Australia things don't seem very as expensive here but when I dined in this restaurant my thoughts were changed. My mate and myself orders beers, chicken chilli and a pasta. To my surprise when our order was served I found no cheese topped on the pasta which was quite unusual and the chicken chilli served had more cheap veggies than chicken and was served cold. I asked the waiter if he could bring me some cheese to sprinkle on the pasta I had ordered. So he did (which I assumed would be a complimentary). But to my absolute surprise while going though the bill I discovered that I was charged NPR160+23%TAX for the parmesan cheese which was just a pinch in a small bowl, which I initially thought was complimentary. Pasta was NPR370+23%TAX & beer was NPR450+23%TAX. I wish I had retained the receipt with me so that I could upload on TripAdvisor. Also food here is very very very expensive and is not affordable by everyone. It is just meant for the people coming from overseas, people who make big bucks. I would highly suggest anyone thinking of going to this restaurant in the near future to reconsider your decision and plan elsewhere. One of the worst restaurant I have dined in Kathmandu."

The Vesper House is now serving the full restaurant menu after the old Cafe building was destroyed, and they have expanded the space to accommodate more people. It is a nice, modern, clean space with plenty of room, although i hope they add a ""play"" room for little ones like the old building had to make it more family friendly.  The service was very friendly and the staff accommodated us and the children. However, a staff member should return to the table after the food has been served to check, and also ask if we want our bill or dessert after the meal. Each time I've eaten at Vesper (both old and new) it's taken forever to ask for and get the bill.

So I ordered a mulled wine, plain soda and a pepperoni pizza with mushrooms and a side of pesto. I was simply shocked to see ""pepperoni"" so I had to try it. I sat by a heater inside and read my book peacefully, sipping the mulled wine, which was overly fragrant (I tried to take a deep breath before I took a drink). I actually loved the flavor of the wine, but wasn't too keen on the spices floating in the wine, i.e. couldn't that be strained off prior to serving? The pizza arrived and I was famished so I inhaled 2 slices without even really taking a moment to make a decision on whether I actually liked it. And ultimately my conclusion was - meh. Something about it just didn't taste right. Maybe it's the cheese, maybe the sauce...crust was alright. But hey I've been living near NYC for nearly 13 years and before that Italy, so what was I expecting. If I went back - though I doubt I will in the next 10 days I'll be here - I'd probably give pasta or risotto a shot."

The momos were definitely the best we had on the trip. If you discount the quality of the peanut sauce that we had elsewhere, by themselves the chicken momos at the Taleju were the best we had in Nepal. They were spiced up to the optimum level and well marinated and consequently I quite enjoyed them as a meal in itself.

After cocktails (try the spicy whiskey one), we ordered the chicken mix and mutton mix platters to begin, and each was delicious... my favorites were the chicken tikka, the mutton kebab bites, and the melt-in-your-mouth cutlets. We then moved on to the chicken inquilab and the butter chicken, and both were great, though the butter chicken is an absolute must-order -- it's among the best dishes I've eaten, and is every bit the blend of spiced, spicy, rich, and tangy that you want it to be. It's flawless.  We were already stuffed but just... couldn't stop? We ordered another round of beers and naan, wiped the chicken dishes clean, and moved on to the gajjar ka halwa, which was a slow-cooked dessert made of carrots, milk, butter, raisins... it was an amazing end to a phenomenal meal.  I'd like to offer a balanced review, but frankly can't think of any critiques of this meal -- the food was stellar, the ambience and service were top-notch, and I'd seriously consider swinging through Kathmandu again soon just to revisit this menu. Five stars, and would give a sixth if I could."

This place showcases Bohra cuisine with recipes passed down through generations. The complexity of flavors and the richness of the dishes showed the TLC put into the cooking. We focused on the kebabs accompanied by Gorkha beer. I have rarely tasted such tender meat. The mutton sigri and chicken cutlet melt in the mouth. The butter chicken is amazing as the gravy is the best that I have tasted. I had the Nihari which was also excellent but the biryani was already finished ( to my deep regret). The restaurant is in an old Nepali house and is spread over three levels. The place was full of groups of friends and family with a really fun vibe. Please go there with a big appetite but I bet you cannot help overeating. The service is amazing and try and get the real cool owners to talk about their food. It makes the food taste even better."

The actual restaurant is very nice too, the beautiful entrance, the terrace and the low tables on the second floor where you sit on chairs resting on the floor.

Furnished with simple decor with seating available indoors and outdoors in an internal courtyard, TKK is a restaurant with no-frills and only authentic finger licking good food.  What makes the entire dining experience at TKK different is how the leading lady Tasneem eloquently explains the whole meal and the significance behind it's origin. Not many restaurants provide you with such a homely service, where you are acknowledged about how the each dish in your meal is prepared.  We pre-ordered the famous Bohra Thaali to celebrate New Year's Eve at TKK. A Bohra meal is a big platter of authentic Bohra Cuisine. The whole meal begins by passing the salt and it is only after each member is seated around and has tasted it that the first course is served. All members from the family dines out of one platter called the thaal. The meal was accommodated for ten people.  Interestingly, the first course is dessert, which was a complete new way of dining for us.The Bohras consider it auspicious to begin their meal with a sweet dish. In the Bohra language, all desserts are called mithaas and the savoury dishes kharaas.  The main course featured lip-smacking Curries for vegetarians and unforgettable Chicken and Mutton dishes for the carnivores teamed with Flavored Rice and Naan Roti. But that’s not all, the meal ended with Gajar Ka Halwa and Paan which is a must for the eaters to cleanse their tongue.  Apart from this, past visits made our family a regular at TKK. The Biryani is legendary here: The meats, herbs and spices are placed in a pot that is then sealed and slow-cooked over a very low flame for hours. The meat cooks in its own juices, taking on the flavors of the seasoning, and resulting in a hearty and aromatic dish that is the specialty of TKK.  All in all, the food is excellent and the servings are very generous. Definitely, worth the value. If you haven't dined at TKK yet then tsk tsk tsk ;)"

It was also a reunion of sorts as when living in Kathmandu ten years ago, we were regulars of Tasneem’s home catering, food perfect for house parties – wholesome deliciousness with homey flavours. Tasneem had since then gone on to open her restaurant and my husband and I were keen to see the place and, of course, to meet Tasneem and her family – it had been exactly ten years since we saw them last. Twelve of us were booked for lunch at TKK and to be honest, we were wondering how the restaurant would manage, expecting a Mom and Pop operation. However, on reaching TKK, we were charmed by the lovely and well run restaurant created by Tasneem and her husband, Harshawardhan.  We were also delighted to find that the food served was as wholesome as we remembered from years ago but the flavours had been upped to pack a restaurant dining experience punch. Right from the aam panna and the jal jeera drinks that we ordered to the starters and the main meal to dessert – every thing was fabulous! As we were 12 of us with different preferences, we made our choices there and then, ordering off the menu, so it can be safely said that everyone else in the restaurant, too, was having the same quality of food that we were served.  Of special mention are the scrumptious Bohra Chicken Cutlets (nothing comes close to the ones served at TKK – even in Bombay which is known for this cutlet) with the mince succulent and a light coating of egg cooked just right; the innovative vegetarian seekh kabab delivering an intense burst of flavour; the fragrant mutton biryani and the equally aromatic vegetable biryani with the delectable pineapple raita; the delicious kababs and tandoor items – vegetarian and non vegetarian – perfectly grilled, lightly crusted on the outside, juicy on the inside.  Saving the best for last is Tasneem’s signature Butter Chicken prepared in a unique way. Instead of the usual chunky tikkas of chicken, you are served pulled chicken (marinated and cooked slowly till tender enough to be pulled into strips) in a rich, creamy gravy. The resultant dish is a luscious blend with the gravy going deep into every bit of chicken unlike the usual dish made with chunks of meat with the gravy only coating the tikka. The Butter Chicken made in Tasneem’s style is also easy to have with the pulled chicken lending itself to being wrapped and eaten in any roti of your choice unlike the tikka style as larger chunks do not hold well in rotis like the thicker tandoori and paratha. While on rotis, there is an assortment of Indian breads, the garlic butter naan being a personal favourite, as is the velvety phirni we ordered for dessert.  It is easy to see that Tasneem has not compromised in any way on the high standards she set for herself when starting out and catering to smaller groups of people with her wholesome and appetizing home catering. For instance, her mutton kababs still have no tallow added, something many commercial establishments resort to, to increase volume and quantity. The change: from catering from her home, her setting is now TKK – a warm and inviting place – where she and her husband make you feel at home, providing exceptional Indian food with the young and enthusiastic wait staff providing excellent service. Tasneem’s home catering set a benchmark in Kathmandu. Her restaurant sets it once again. Will be back for the Nihari and Kabsa. Good luck and best wishes."

I've been coming back to Tasneems for almost two years now and I've never had a bad meal here, ever. Tasneem, the ever present host, is always there greeting at the door, stepping through the dishes to suit your mood and always ready to give recommendations.  Indian food in Kathmandu has oddly never been a strength for this city despite its proximity. Tasneem's Kings Kitchen is one of those locations where the food is an absolute labour of love, hard to find spices are imported by Tasneem and she puts them to excellent use.  Last night I was invited to a traditional Bora meal (8 people required), I didn't know much going into it. What awaited was multiple courses ranging from custard to carrot pudding to amazing mutton slow cooked over 14 hours. It was an absolute delight, our entire group savored each and every mouthful. (Let her know in advance that you want the Thaal Bohra feast)  There has been some recent additions to the restaurant providing covering over their bar and reception area, beautiful lighting and a wonderful courtyard. My special recommendations, go for biryani, butter chicken, naan and some chicken Multani Wings. Actually, try everything on the menu at least once, beautiful tasty food awaits. Tasneem puts everything into every dish, so, if you're looking for authentic family style dishes then look no further."

Lets start with the ambiance, we were a large group of friends of 18 and were seated in the portico surrounded by plants that contributed to a natural water conservation system that self sustains the restaurants water requirements. Well appointed solar panels that do not jar the sights also contribute towards the power requirements of the restaurant. All of this is discretely set in a very natural environment. A place where you would like to relax and enjoy your food.  Then to the food itself. Had 6 starters cannot decide which one should get a special mention. All had it's unique flavours and authenticity, a welcome change from restaurants that have a common base for all foods. Most of the starters had the ""Bohra"" touch. For those not in the know the ""Bohra's"" are a small community in India that is know for it's unique dishes that tickle every palate and want in you. The serving that night certainly stirred my want to come back to the restaurant again and I was still on my starters. The of course was the main course, difficult to beat the starters was my initial thought and kept my expectations not that high. The lamb stole my heart, the best I have had in the valley in terms of texture and taste served with freshly made Indian breads. Lets just say if you like Indian food and are in the Kathmandu Valley this hygienic, environmentally friendly restaurant is a MUST VISIT. Oh did I mention that this restaurant is run by a wonderful couple who are dedicated in ensuring that your visit is an experience and not just a meal.  PS The cocktails were gratifying, complementing the food"

This is not something we would eat every other week but it is the best way for us to celebrate an occasion. If you love Indian Muslim cuisines then this is the authentic flavors you get in Kathmandu. I have tired Biryani is different cities of India and the cooking process and the ingredients are different. You have to try Tasleem's biryani to get the taste of Muslim Bohra cooking. The Chicken Butter Masala Boneless is their signature dish and it just melts in your mouth. It has a dash of sweetness to it but it goes very well with Naan or Tandoori Roti.

The restaurant offers both outdoor and indoor seating. The ambience is subtle with modest cots placed at the entrance and simple yet comfortable furniture to seat you. The decor is minimalistic, creative and tastefully done to present a unique dining experience. Rainwater harvesting at the restaurant speaks volumes about the owner's commitment to offer a sustainable culinary experience to it's customers. We have been to the restaurant twice and have already become great admirers of the food that they serve here. The chicken butter masala is a speciality of TKK and it's delicious. You have to try it to experience a whole new taste for this otherwise run of the mill dish. You can request for the dishes to be made spicy or not so spicy as preferred by you. We had also ordered for some chicken biryani and the chicken in the biryani literally melted in our mouths. I have never had chicken that soft ever in my life. My dad does not normally like eating outdoors. Even he ended up having more than his normal share of the food! The most important part of any dining experience for us is the hospitality. The TKK staff does a fine job here. Beginning with getting your hands washed using the bowl and pitcher, already makes you feel special. This is an experience you probably wouldn't find at many restaurants. Dishes are served with a smile and the owner, Tasneem can often be seen interacting with the guests at the restaurant. This restaurant has several items to offer and we have only explored a few. There's a lot more still remaining to have us visiting the place several times over!"

I love the way chef Tasneem comes over to each table once the guests are seated, to make sure that their expectations are met, with care.  My own experience with TKK regarding their service for home parties has been very pleasant, every time I sought for it.

We had a couple appetizers, Kashmir Chicken and Palak Paneer, Jaree rice and chipati bread. They also gave us a sample of their signature dish, Butter Chicken. The food we ordered was fantastic, but the Butter Chicken was divine. If you go, try their signature dish, but based on our experience, you cant go wrong no matter what you order. I get the impression that our dishes were not as spicy as they normally make them as we had two small children with us and we asked them to keep it spiced for the kids. My husband had gone with a friend on a different occasion and he said that the food was much spicier (and delicious!).  But the food was only the half of it. The owner is so kind and engaging. Made us feel so welcome. Our waiter made recommendations on how much to order (perfect amount!), the food came out fast but without making us feel hurried. The best part was that we had brought our 16 month old and 3 year old with us, and the staff helped us entertain them so we could enjoy our meal. I don't expect that can happen every time (eg if its a particularly busy night), but it made the whole experience perfect."

We were told to go here, so we made the walk. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and promptly sat outside in the patio area. The decorations and aura gave this place an authentic feel for an Indian restaurant.  We got our menus and started thinking about our order, when a lady (who turned out to be Tasneem herself) came by to help us decide what to order. I am an American who cannot normally handle a lot of heat from the spices, but I was traveling with two guys who love spicy food. She encouraged us to get a couple appetizers as well as some different dishes.  My absolute favorites were the Mutton Appetizer and the House Special Butter Chicken. The Mutton is pounded flat, then spiced and fried. It is still moist, but crispy. The flavour seems to just be jam-packed in this bite. Then came the Butter Chicken. I haven't had a dish that tasted this delicious in a while. The food textures of meat and gravy melt together leaving this savory experience. Pair this with their garlic butten naan, and you have a winner.  They had some happy hour specials on local beers and cocktails. The mocktails are made with fresh juices.  We then met Tasneem's husband. They were very kind and gave us recommendations for things to do in Kathmandu and surrounding areas. I strongly recommend going to see Tasneem if you visit. You will not be disappointed. We liked it so much, we came back for a second meal in 4 days there.  The second time, we ended up ordering pretty much the same; we just knew what to expect. We were able to add a little heat to the dishes this time, and it was still amazing for all of us.  It is nice in the patio area, with the cool breezes and the ambiance. There is no wifi as they encourage you to talk with your table, but this does not mean that they are not engaged with their customers. The owners take pride in the ability to listen to customers and their experiences.  Do yourself a favour and check this place out."

The name might seem synonymous to a cigarette brand with the 'kings' making appearance in the restaurant name but the food seemed rich and healthy as it gets. This comes perfectly at a time when I had given up all hopes in the country to find decent food (barring the quintessential masu bhaat and defacto nepali national dish momo) forget a stellar biryani which comes across as the most celebrated food article of my existance.  Tasneem's name popped up through referrals from the limited social circle I maintain in the city and stumbling upon a tasting session which introduced me to Seekh Kabab Biryani (not sure mutton or chicken) which left me spellbound until I could have a more heartier meal from the lady's 'kings' kitchen.  Lo & Behold... comes my sonny's second birthday!!  Whats for the menu?? with a pretentious hesitance (considering my unfaltering suggestion 'Biryani') I suggested 'Biryani' to my wife from 'kings' kitchen which all my desi and Nepali friend circle would wholesomely enjoy a cuisine from my birth place 'Mumbai' which I could show off without being failed upon through the 'kings' kitchen by the first lady of biryani 'Tasneem'; given a rare free hand by the DMA of my household I grabbed my opportunity of placing the order for my guests liberally and as I willed. The menu for the party was Chicken Biryani, Mutton Korma, Chicken Cutlets and grilled chicken legs. So let us categorically go through the real epiphany of the gastronomical trip...  1. Chicken Biryani: meat a little too well cooked with well endowed flavors that reminded me of the scene from 'ratatouille' where the critic is pulled back to childhood which was a similar emotional shockwave I went through with the first morsel with the scent of Mumbai. Quality of rice was as authentic as it gets perfect long grain with the right girth.  2. Mutton Korma: the taste still lives on my taste buds tickling the neurons every time I think about it. Slightly spicy with amazing quality of meat which is a rare feat in this country, worth a try.  3. Chicken Cutlets: a little less oil than produced by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia which dripped out of each piece but tasted great, I would suggest it to be had right at the restaurant considering the egg batter it was fried in retained much of the oil and turned it soggy by the time they reached home.  4. Grilled chicken legs: were as good as one made at home with utter amount of care and love (through liberal amount of masala) before it was grilled. Still I would say a little overcooked as the meat left the bone while it was picked up from the plate.  5. Paneer Chole Biryani: was for one lonewolf in the gang who was a vegetarian, where the verdict was pretty clear when she requested for a doggy bag of remaining biryani. Since I hadn't tasted it, i cannot brag much.  All the dishes were accompanied by copious amount of Kanda (like we call in Mumbai)/Pyaaz (for more North Indian expose) and other salad items.  Nevertheless, Tasneem is going to see a lot of me in her 'kings' kitchen where I would wish to sample every dish on the menu before I leave this country.  The place would definitely has the potential to be an iconic (the bloody real deal not the Nepali excuse for) Indian cuisine in the time to come. So brace up you lady, I would be recommending the place to every person I come across preaching it like a religion."

The cafe has a great atmosphere, although there is a bit of noise from the street on the other side of the wall and there's a variety of seating.

They serve fresh roasted Himalayan coffee -- not unusual in this part of town, but in this case, it's mighty good. French press or pour-over. Fancier coffee drinks available too. The iced lemon-mint is also quite nice. Plenty of fresh mint, but without coming across as an over-hydrated salad.  I'd consider the Gurkha Wrap to be their unofficial house specialty. It's chock full of delicious morning munchies, and accompanied by a bit of spicy sauce and sweet yogurt.  The English Breakfast is exactly what one should expect. Perfectly runny eggs, real pork sausage with real pork sausage taste, and tender breakfast potatoes. The baked beans, though likely from a can, are accented by a few tweaks from the chef, which makes them downright respectable. The chef, by the way, is a veteran of Radisson, so he has a decent idea of what westerners want in a late morning, lightly hungover meal.  On the topic of staff, I can't say enough nice things. We poked our heads in through the gate to ask if they served breakfast, and if they'd mind our dogs on the patio. The waitress, sunny as day, replied, ""Oh DEFINITELY! Welcome to Kairos Cafe!"" Her cheerful countenance didn't diminish for even a moment during our entire stay. And it was genuine. Like she enjoyed working there!  Feel good about eating here. Part of your money benefits their efforts to stop human trafficking. As if you didn't feel good enough about how that Gurkha Wrap filled your belly!  The ambient music is just that: ambient. None of this trying-too-hard downtempo house. Simply, it's brunch music. Easygoing jams that your girlfriend / wife enjoys... and you secretly sing along to when you're the only one home. Were you thinking of Jack Johnson just now? Ben Harper? Ryan Adams? Me too.  The only negative is the relative location. It's across from that high school by the zoo. They're doing construction, so our brunch-time conversation was accented by clanging and crashing of steel beams from just over the wall. Also, there's that dust pit of a road.  I almost hate to review this place. I don't want it to become the next Soma, where I'm doomed to run into everyone I know, when all I crave is french press coffee and a (complimentary) copy of the Himalayan Times. But a business with the sensibility of Kairos must be celebrated and supported. And with the current fuel shortage, they may be the last place in Patan where you can score a decent brunch. They had the foresight to stock up, but who knows for how long that will last?"

The nice thing about the atmosphere is its location in a quiet dead end parking area. Expect a more student, casual atmosphere. Not a place a to sit down to do work but more to hang with friends. Some of the decor is quite funky, i do like it, albeit its maybe too 'busy' with all the posters and leaflets.  As it was our first time, we were totally confused what to do. The person didn't communicate very well when i asked what to do. Apparently you order the coffee and pick it up yourself, paying later but there are no prices...you pay what you think its worth.

It is run by an Austrian lady and she keeps on adding new products to her portofolio constantly. The place is coffee-shop and showroom at the same time, where you can not only drink coffee but also shop for locally produced, recycled or imported products related to coffee. Lucky for me, they have added tea to their menue some time ago, which is also grown in Nepal - like the coffee - and of outstanding quality.  The ""kar.ma"" in the name probably refers to the pricing system for the coffee specialities - there is no menue - you just pay what you think it's worth. Because of that it's not one of the many overpriced restaurants in the area where you usually only meet foreigners or rich Nepalis, but just about everyone that likes to have a coffee or tea once in a while. The coffee-shop has quickly developed into a meeting place for many ex-pats living in the area and people working in nearby offices. Many customers are also coming from the ""Pranamaya Yoga Studio"" below the place or the ""Kathmandu Jazz Conservatory"" right above. Interesting conversations and new friendships are nearly inevitable which makes it a perfect starting point if you are new to the area. If there is no one around to talk to, you can always use the free Wifi to surf the net until somebody interesting shows up. Be careful as this place is somehow addictive. For me and some of my friends it has become something like an external living room!  They don't have a food menue as such but sell various home-made organic cookies. As they cooperate with nearby restaurants, you can ask them to order sandwiches or other simple foods which are then delivered to the coffee-shop."

I arrived on a Sunday evening (I was staying at the Piano B&B above the restaurant). I walked in and instantly knew this was somewhere I could trust. I told the owner, Antonio that I was too tired to think and to just choose what he thought I should eat. There are very few restaurants I would be happy to have choose the food for me, Piano B is one of them. The food is absolutely delicious! I mean every single thing they make is delicious, from the fresh bread, olive oil and balsamic to nibble on while you order, to the cheese and meat plater to the perfectly al dente pasta dishes to the high quality wine they store.  Antonio has established an amazing little restaurant and to anyone in Kathmandu who has heard of Piano B but never visited, you really need to go there. This guy is working his butt off to deliver quality and having spent 7 weeks in Kathmandu this summer, I have seen the time and effort he is putting into his place.  Having stayed at the B&B above I had the pleasure of eating many many times at this restaurant, its hard to find food this good in my current city of Boston, never mind Kathmandu. And if you're reading this thinking, ""Italian food? In Nepal? Why?"" then you've the same thought my colleagues had when they travelled to Nepal for 4 days last week towards the end of my trip. After I took them there, one commented in the morning that he dreamt of the Spinach Ravioli and despite the two thinking I was crazy to take them to an Italian on their four day visit to Nepal, they insisted we go back the very next night, and were again served with the same amazing food.  Like the B&B the restaurant is well managed, the staff are polite and professional, the ambience is tasteful as is the music. They stock real beer, real wine, real COFFEE, and trust me all of it meets the highest of standards of a classy Italian restaurant. I would say this is the best restaurant in all of Kathmandu and probably Nepal, yes its not traditional Nepali food, but quality is quality!  So just go there! And get the little onion dish starter thing. Oh and the chocolate lava cake. And an espresso to finish. And drink their house white.  I'm coming back!"

It was good to walk into this buzzy little place on a Friday night and the food was indeed good but the big disappointment is that for a wine bar/restaurant with a reputedly serious attitude to wine, the wait staff have no basic training in understanding wine. When I enquired what grape variety an unfamiliar wine on the list was, I was told it was ""dry."" When I repeated my enquiry about which grape it had been made from, I was told ""No grapes - dry."" What a shame in an otherwise commendable place. Disappointing also was the lack of contact from the (presumably) owner manager. I tried two or three times to make eye contact to exchange pleasantries with no success. After reading the reviews, I had assumed (bad idea) that he would understand the importance of relationship-building and hosting in the hospitality industry. The ambience was very pleasant and there is an excellent list of imported food and wine items which must be a real achievement in Nepal. The Friday night buzz was high but personally too noisy for a mature age quiet enjoyment. An excellent wine bar, but as a passionate wine love, please educate the staff."

The oil is of good quality and they make a fresh gelato (ice cream) as well as good tiramisu. The restaurant is run with passion, and the idea is one of reproducing Italian food as much as possible. Here, luckily, you would not find things like ""spaghetti bolognese"" that ARE NOT ITALIAN and are honestly disgusting, but tagliatelle with rabbit sauce, or freshly made pesto, or spaghetti with bottarga. THIS Is Italian. They are using real olive oil, and also real Italian cocktails, like ""spritz"" are available. PIano B is highly, higly recommended."

I had a spinach ravioli and my husband had tuna steak. Both well prepared. Couldn't manage the chocolate mousse but looked wonderful. If you're a touristi, the location saying ""Patan"" may be confusing as Patan is generally the area where the temples are found and it is a good 3 miles away from Piano. If you're getting a taxi, say ""Jawalakhel Chowk"" (roundabout) - all taxi drivers know this. Beyond that, it is almost opposite DFID offices which some taxis will know. The map on trip advisor seems accurate so once you reach the chowk, take the road that the zoo is on and continue for about 1/4 mile. The road bears round to the right and Piano is just past the bend. It is a convenient place to go to if you have visited Patan temples - currently closed due to earthquake - or the free trade shops along the Pulchowk road."

Unless you have already done everything there is to do here in Khatmandu, you might want to skip this one. I really hoped that the display of asian and Nepali wildlife would be worth the visit, but , ..... There were very few photo oportunities here as everything was through chain link fencing, very old school zoo and cages. No beautiful Tigers, no Snow leopard. A very old and tired looking elephant, many animals alone in cages without companions, overall kind of a depressing display. The highlight were the two huge Pelicans that had just been fed , they were trying to swallow these huge fish, and also escape the person, Me, who was standing between them and their destination their lake. wingspans had to be close to 7' across, they were actually quite intimidating."

Despite many challenges they are doing their best and improvements have been made.  Almost all of the animals are native to the region which was nice.

Most of the animals are kept in small cages. The variety of animals is small and the entry fee is relatively not worth for a foreigner. It costs 500 Rs while you can have a good meal with this amount of money in Kathmandu. In most of the zoos I've visited in the past I could spend at least 2 hours but for this one 0.5 hour is already enough. If you want to visit a zoo in asia, tai pei or ho chih ming city has much much much better zoo than this one. And the visitors really need to be educated as I even saw a man feed the cheese ball to the goat!!!"

We asked them why the bill is rather expensive for just two cups of hot drinks. They said it’s because of the gov tax and 10% service charge. We politely asked them to recalculate the bill and it came up now to the same price. So we checked the menu and did the calculation ourselves. Alas! after 13% gov tax and 10% service charge the total bill was Rupee 175. We mentioned it to the staff and they did their calculation for the third time using the same calculator and it was just Rupee 175. No apology comes with it. I would like to give them benefit of the doubt because people in Nepal are honest and friendly. Sadly the staff in this place doesn’t live to our expectations.

The menu is vast and what we ordered (Chinese) was really bland and terrible. We had 3 dishes all disappointing.

We wondered where on earth we were going to be left for our first night in Kathmandu! So it was a surprise to be led down an alleyway - and into a completely different world, to the beautiful and quaint old-world charm of the courtyard of The Inn. Much of the timber construction is beautifully carved. Our rooms on the first floor, looking onto a roof garden and a back courtyard as well as the central courtyard, were beautifully furnished.  The meals were excellent, eaten under balconies around the courtyard."

The Patan Durbar Square has many distinctive and interesting temples and structures: Krishna Temple, Royal Palace Patan, Jagannarayan Temple, Keshav Narayan Temple, Char Naarayan Temple, Golden Temple and others. When we had visited Patan Durbar Square on November 2019, we found most all of the structures here had been either not affected by the 2015 earthquake or were repaired quickly - we saw only a couple of structures that were being ""repaired"". This is in contrast to the Kathmandu Durbar Square which had multiple structures that are still in need of earthquake damage repair when we had visited that location. In summary, the Patan Durbar Square is in excellent shape - almost all the structures show no earthquake damage and the whole area is visually quite stunning as you enter the Square. The Ancient Nepal architecture here at the Square looks very impressive and makes for good photography. Highly recommend seeing the Patan Durbar Square, and if you have time walk down through some of the side streets to see the residential areas that surrounds the Square - interesting!"

But it is great to see such beautiful structures.  The square also has loads of market/shop stalls with people selling loads of stuff. Haggle and negotiate, but not too much because the prices are already quite reasonable. Beware, most of the “North face” jackets are fake, still very warm and decent quality but not good if you’re gonna go mountaineering!  Just a short walk from Durbar square is the Kumari living goddess of Patan. Go and visit her and receive Tika."

Our guide spent a lot of time telling us about the reconstruction, and it appears that it is going well and will look as it did before the earthquake when finished. Almost every building is propped up with huge boards to stabilize them, and large cracks are seen everywhere.  There are still plenty of beautiful carvings to see on the buildings and carved stone figures and statues throughout. We went to visit the house of the Kumari Devi (the Living Goddess). We could not go in but were allowed in the courtyard to see if she would make an appearance at a window. No photos allowed if she appeared. She did appear and looked out at everyone. This goddess is a 5 year old girl who lives apart from her family until she reaches puberty. It was quite an interesting story.  Worth a visit even though some people complained about the entrance fee. The entrance fee is worth it if this trip is something that you will probably never do again, so why not?"

I didn't enter Kathmandu Durbar Square cause of the expensive entrance fee but it seemed in complete disarray and didn't think there would be much to see.  The Patan Durbar Square also has a lot of rehabilitation going on but it's not as tight and stressful to get into as the Kathmandu one. There's a lot more space to move around and most of the main building has been preserved.  A huge plus about going to Patan Durbar Square is that it houses the Patan Museum, which is easily the best museum I've been to in Nepal. It was very informative and described facts about Hindi and Buddhist history, iconography, symbolisms, and belief systems. I really appreciated that. Because of this, you wouldn't need a tour guide anymore.  Some groups got a tour guide and they sometimes spoke loudly to be heard. Because of that, I would get some interesting new information at random and that was a nice little surprise.  I highly recommend going to this place!"

The old palace is amazing, and has been turned into a very informative museum. The detail in the wood carving is ridiculous! It must have taken many hours of work to do all of the fine etching that is evident. The details are incredible. The Newari architecture is very interesting and picturesque.  The area was hit by the earthquake and is still evident, but much of the restoration has already been started, The 1000 Ru entry fee is well worth it, especially if part of the money helps the locals restore the site (which is all being done by hand).

However after paying my admission fee [Foreigners Rate] NR 1,000 at the ticketing booth I noticed my driver chatting with another young man & verbally disagreeing in their own language, on explaining the situation from the driver this young man wanted me to pay another admission fee of NR 1,000 due to my driver not being an offical registered or licensed tour guide. I ended up walking around the Square on my own after expressing my opinion to the difficult young man interfering without any signage about tour guides / drivers etc . After one hour I left still annoyed. The Square is a busy area with many locals & visitors & great to see that many of the buildings that were either completely destroyed or partially during the 2015 earthquake were being re-built or structurally renovated with strong support beams throughout the process.

Still, the government is charging an entrance fee just to step into the area, which seems to only be enforced on western tourists, with locals and Asian tourists seemingly about to enter at will. I had no problem paying the fee, assuming it was going towards the restoration, but we heard much to the contrary from locals.  The big issue with this area are the guides waiting around. These are not the friendly Nepalese people you are used to. One guide, after we told him we weren’t interested in a tour, immediately called over the ticket officers to check us. A second berated us for “wasting our time and money coming there” if we weren’t willing to hire him. Just be polite, smile and move on."

Let's be honest here. Patan's Durbar Square is a shadow of its former grandeur, and every structure is largely hidden under extensive scaffolding. The Museum (which is part of your 1,000rp ticket) only had 1/8th of its exhibition space open for public use, with the rest being refurbished/repaired.  My partner and I are empathetic with the earthquake repair process, and are happy considering our payment there as a donation. However, it is disingenuous (and honestly somewhat manipulative) to pretend otherwise.  The very high price of entry is a donation towards mending the damage of the earthquake, and should not be taken as indicative of the quality of the experience in Patan's Durbar Square.  Left feeling quite deflated and disappointed."

The central square is interesting, full of magnificent buildings, temples, shops and always a lot of people. It is located 5 km south of central Kathmandu, across the Bagmati River. Like everything in Nepal and this city has a rich history. Patan is founded in the 3rd century A.D by King Veera Dev. Durbar Square is enriched by the magnificent ancient Royal Palace. The monuments in this square date back to the Medieval Malla period from 16th to 18th century. Bhimsen Temple, Vishwa Nath Temple, Temple Jagnath leave visitors breathless."

Though quite narrow and crowded at times, the alleys are full of sudden discoveries of temples, courtyards and other old buildings. The work on some of these entrances and doors is exquisite. Patan is a great example of the old and the new coexisting seamlessly almost to an extent where they become part of each other. An old building becomes a new coffee shop. A temple yard is occupied by a bunch of youngsters meeting to chat about their weekend or a central pond is fringed by vendors whose wares are reflected in its dusty waters. Worth walking around here for some hours to chance upon some truly spectacular pieces of art and sculpture."

Patan is also known as Lalitpur. Both names derive from the Sanskrit word ""Lalitapattan"". Locally many people still call it Lalitpur while tourists sectors refer to it as Patan. Nepal was hit by an earthquake on April 25th 2015 . It was a magnitude of 7.8, followed by aftershocks including a large magnitude 7.3 quake on 12 May. This earthquake it is also known as the Gorkha earthquake. It killed nearly 9,000 people and injured nearly 22,000. The Dubar Square is a UNESCO World Heritage since 1979.It is a historical square with beautiful religious and historical monuments that reflects the history of Nepal despite the earthquake damages. Many monuments are still awaiting restoration, and thousands are still waiting for permanent housing, the scars of the earthquake are slowly being erased, and tourist as us, are returning. One of the square attraction is the ancient Royal Palace where the Malla Kings of Lalitpur resided. The Durbar Square is a marvel of Newa architecture. The Square floor is tiled with red bricks. There are many temples and idols in the area. The main temples are aligned opposite of the western face of the palace. The entrance of the temples faces east, towards the palace. There is also a bell situated in the alignment beside the main temples. The Square also holds old Newari residential houses. There are various other temples and structures in and around Patan Durbar Square built by the Newa People. The Square maintains its legendary atmosphere.

Bhaktapur was most hit by the 2015 earthquakes and Patan least. And reconstruction is actually going on here, in contrast to DS in Kathmandu. Patan's DS is also the smallest and therefor the most intimite. I really love that intimite feeling while wondering around many temples. These temples, like Golden Temple, are far more beautiful than those in Kathmandu. Art is more refined and richer. And you'll find Patan museum here. I think the most beautiful museum in Nepal. But read separate reviews on this one. Also take a stroll thru the small and narriw streets surrounding the square. Here you'll find high-end and low-end art. Just love this place!"

Am taking half day tours to various cities and venues. Today I visited Durbar Square in Patan, not far from Kathmandu. My guide asked me ""Do you want to see a living goddess?"" I replied "" You mean The Kumari?"" He said ""You know The Kumari"" and I explained that I studied the Nepali tradition of worshipping living goddesses. We went to the home she lives in with her family. My guide said to wait as he would see if she was sleeping. She saw me. What a thrill! The living goddess is seven years old and two years into her ""reign"" and she appeared to be stoic, fearless, and very very special. She gave me a blessing and I asked for blessings for some docent friends who would appreciate the gesture. The Kumari then rubbed a red paste pigment on my forehead. I placed a small donation on her large tray near her throne. I have great respect for cultural traditions that do not harm people. Durbar Square is worth seeing. Many cities in Nepal have a square called Durbar Square in which a former palace was built. Most of the palaces in this region were damaged in,and restored after, the earthquake of 2015. Many countries and charities donated to the efforts and it is remarkable how quickly buildings were restored. Stroll through the side paths of the square, get ""lost"" alone or with a guide, see chickens, people working, people making food, embroidering cloths, eat at a local place to taste their cuisine, TALK to the people, at least try. Students like to practice their English with tourists. Yes, as others have noted, pay the 1000 or 1500 rupees entrance fee to these UNESCO sites and take it all in. They are worth every rupee!"

The entry fee is more than reasonable and the museum is an absolute must.

Work to repair them has begun and is slow and painstaking. To help pay, there's now a charge (750 Nepali Rs / $7.50 /£4.80) which seems steep but it's a good cause. If you want to, you can slip through a side street and enter without paying. It's worth exploring the side streets anyway as they contain some stunning historic carved wooden buildings. Although the square itself is free of commercialism, you'll be plagued by persistent hawkers around it and there are loads of little shops selling mass-produced souvenirs. You can bargain prices down ... or you could buy from an excellent Fairtrade shop on the edge of the square where the profits go to remote Nepali villages."

On the right side, royal palaces with courtyards (Sundari Chowk - with sunken bath, Mul Chowk and Mani Keshar Chowk), the Golden Temple & Museum, 3 other temples (Taleju, Degutale, Mani) and the ancient water source, Manga Hiti. Small fees applied to enter the palaces and museum on top of the square's entrance ticket of NPR 500/US$ 5, but it's worth it.

The fountain with a princess' busto has a memerizing legend story. Long Story, short: She was an untouchable (caste) and beautiful, sitting at edge of the road in her poor garments. The prince passing by on his horse saw her and fell in love at her First sight, even though she was an untouchable, and wanted to marry her.

Different than the squares in Kathmandu and Bakhtapur, the Durbar Square of Lalitpur hardly shows any signs of the destruction anymore, rubble has been removed and buildings are being rebuilt. The super interesting Patan Museum and its nice (and a little expensive) garden café was open (apart from a few, destroyed parts of the building everything was accessible) and the square is less busy than its two counterparts in the valley. It is a great place to hang out, stroll around and witness everyday life in Nepal. Across the street, above the market stalls and up a narrow staircase, there is an amazing café/restaurant (sadly, I don't remember the name) with the most beautiful woodcarved windows, through which you can watch the square and its inhabitants while enjoying a plate of momos and a cup of sweet chia. You'll have a great view of the central Vishnu temple and the Garud statue, as well as most of the old palace, which is now the Patan Museum."

Inaccurate reporting also said Kathmandu was leveled (it wasn't).  I was not able to get to Patan in May of 2015 but just did so on my return to Kathmandu in 2016.  The central district is a treasure trove of what did NOT fall down. Walking the narrow amazing side streets with the rare Nepalese architecture of intricately carved dark wood and red brick - my heart beat with joy. Yes, there was damage and I expected to see huge now vacant areas where there once was something and now there is not. But in the main square area I did not find evidence of this anywhere.  The entire central area deserves your slow, intricate wandering. It is quieter, more restful than Kathmandu Durbar Square. No taxis and motorbikes allowed in the main square.  Have a Lavazza coffee, sit in a rooftop cafe overlooking the square, sit with locals and have a tea or coffee with them, ask them where they were at earthquake time - they will love to talk with you. Wander the antique and souvenir shops, have local food on a side street, stay in a hotel or bed and breakfast - there are some great ones. Go into the several beautiful temples just off the main square. Go into the museum.  Do not hurry when you visit this site - there is a feel you want to capture. It is ancient and it is alive. You will feel blessing here. Guaranteed..  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

Patan Durbar Square is also a good place to see beautiful examples of palaces, temples and shrines, and the stunning stone carvings in the Sundari Courtyards. The entire city of Patan was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979."

The square also houses the Patan Museum, which is simply amazing. It is easy to walk from here to the nearby Mahabuddha temple. There are fairly regular religious processions and performances in the square as well. Overall, I strongly recommend a visit to this square and the surrounding historic neighborhood - many of the buildings are remarkably old, featuring period carvings and architecture."

You still have to pay to get into the area of the Square - but all the sourrounding streets are far more welcoming and you are treated as less of a target for touts etc etc in this square.  A relativeley small area the square is a rectangular shaped area bordered on one side by the old Palace and on the other side of a wide thoroughfare are a variety of temples. The locals transit through the square and it does have a genuine local feel to it.  Unlike Kathmandu this square is blocked off for cars and mopeds, and it does look like they have spent some of the entrance fee on improving the infrastructure.  Concidering the short distance from the centre of Khatmandu I would thoroughly reccomend a trip here - it's a far better Durbar Sq (Although not quite as good as Bhaktapurs)."

Remember, these attractions demand payment from foreigners but not locals. Negotiate with the guide first though. I paid 1/2 of what my guide was asking. In addition, confirm how much time they will be spending with you. The reason to get a guide is to ensure you find the Buddhist Golden Temple which is hidden down some side streets from the primarily Hindu buildings. 500 Rupees for entry fee. The architecture is very cool and about 500 years old. The Golden Temple is worth the extra 50 Rupees entrance fee. Gold-plated and from the 12th century. Be ready to say 'no' to being taken to more shops as that is common with these guides who receive a kickback."

Westerners pay a higher entry ticket price (roughly 1000Rs), but the day-ticket can be extended for several days until the end date of your visa if you bring it to show at the ticket counter. This square seems to be the center of business as well, so taxis from here are easy to find. Don't miss the museum and the Museum Cafe! You may be approached for tours of the area that usually start at 1200Rs, but negotiate hard. Some tour guides will take you to Tibetan shops to sell you singing bowls and paintings--all beautiful and whatnot, but steeply overpriced. Be sure to negotiate very low for these if you do want to purchase. Otherwise, don't cave in to pressure or let your guide know you aren't willing to buy before entering."

The brick buildings were completely mazing. One side of the road was a row of palaces which were 400 years old. The other side were all temples about 900 years old. According to our guide the street use to be a river. The area is completely alive. Once a year, at the palace courtyard, they still sacrifice 108 buffalo and they hang the intestine on the door. The local Nepalese are every where, sitting around, chatting and watching the world go by. Down a flight of stairs, women are busy filling up their portable water into jerry cans and then carrying it around their heads back home - absolutely back-aching work. Some tips: 1. Across the street is a store and if you go up the stairs, there is a picture perfect opportunity for the entire street scene. 2. No point to pay for a guide. Ours charged us USD20 and the information was simple. Of course it saved us reading up on things on looking for the small nooks."

Founded in the 3rd century, Patan is also called Lalitpur or 'Beautiful City'. According to my guidebook, there are 55 major temples in this city alone and 136 courtyards many of which make this beautiful section of the city a photographer's paradise.  We strolled through this marvelous square and spent about three hours enjoying the sights, sounds, smells, and colors of this magnificent World Heritage site. We started with the Royal Palace to our right and moved on to the Sacred Well just beyond. The water that comes out of the spouts comes from a water source miles away. There is the pillar surmounted by a gilt statue of King Yoganarendra Malla shaded by the hooded cobra that hovers over him and the simply splendid Krishna Mandir with its colonnades and porches and a huge dome over all.  I really wish I had the time to come back here because there is so much to see that I probably overlooked a lot. On the day of our visit, the square was very crowded because there was an election rally with thousands of people waving flags and listening to the speakers. There were pilgrims and monks visiting the religious sites and temples, shoppers bustling about, and tourists dining at cafes and restaurants. The place has an energy level that can't be beat.  We also moved on to the Golden Temple in the north part of town. Again, very exciting. See my photos as these are worth a thousand words. Note that there is a small fee to enter this area of the city. Pay it without complaint as it helps to preserve this marvelous complex."

It is one of the world heritage durbar squares in Kathmandu area, the other two being Thamel and Bhaktapur.The place was decked up and full of tourists, the atmosphere festive. We could see some signs of the animal sacrifices that had taken place in the morning.. The museum, however, was closed as it was a national holiday..  The architecture and layout of the square is fascinating. Most of the monuments were built in the 17th century by Malla Kings. Newari architecture at its best. Red stone and bricks and intricate wood carvings adorn the numerous Hindu and Buddhist shrines and monuments. The Krishna temple- the only 'Krishna' temple in the area, as Nepalese Hindus traditionally worship Durga/Shakti- is a fine example of Shikhara architecture.  There is a small entry fee for foreigners. Take a leisurely walk and as you soak in the beauty and the atmosphere, and enjoy and admire the art and architecture. My preferred method in such places is not to try and see everything but enjoy bits and pieces as the excess of sensory stimuli can be exhausting! The quaint rooftop European cafes that dot the area are an added attraction and are great for a coffee (or beer!) and snacks.."

It is an amazing collection of Buddhist and Hindu buildings. Patan / Lalitpur is 15 minutes drive from Kathmandu south across the Bagmati River. Its a wonderful place to wander for a couple of hours, with no cars in your way. There is a ticket kiosk at the entrance to the square, it costs 500rs and you have to wear a sticker. Around the entrance there are pushy people wanting to be your guide, even small children are in on the act. One said to me ""sooner or later you will have to give in"". You don't need a guide, I found them so persistent I headed straight for a rooftop café called Café du Temple and just sat there reading about the square and viewing it from afar. The square can be very relaxing if you find your own secluded spot. Children play badmington, people wash their clothes in a nearby well. Make sure you set aside a couple of hours for the museum. Look out for some Bull's instestines hanging over a door near the museum."

This Durbar Square is, however, in Patan which, at one time, would have been separate from old Kathmandu. Kathmandu has extended so much it has now swallowed areas that might have, historically, been townships in their own right.  Patan Durbar Square has more impressive temples and historic sights than its counterpart in Kathmandu. Don't visit Nepal without seeing both, however, as each has something to offer.  A pleasant thing about Durbar Square is that one isn't hassled, or at least not too much, by persons offering to act as a guide, sell one souvenirs, etc. Be sure to bargain with taxi drivers, as they will almost inevitably try and overcharge you. The same applies to shops and stalls selling handicrafts, Pashmina shawls and souvenirs. One can end up paying very considerably less than what the seller initially demands. A good time to buy is nearing the end of the day. Traders find it hard to avoid the temptation to make one last sale and some real bargains can be obtained in these circumstances."

The temple at the square is very old and the carvings are erotic. Have a good look. Vendors and shopkeepers do not overcharge if you can bargain. I find it bad that western tourists have to pay to visit this place when anybody else can walk in and out. School kids are everywhere, one cannot take a decent picture of a monument or statue without some kids sitting on it. This was the same in Bahktapur where I had regretted that I had paid 10 euro when I saw that so many walked in without paying. A visit to the museum still has to be paid extra anyway. In Patan, they try to avoid that people walk in without paying (only if you look western, speaking of discrimination) by obliging you to hang the large ticket around your neck. Just awful. It spoiled my appreciation of this wonderful old place, having this thing around my neck. I felt like an animal for sale. Why not make the entrance free for all without discrimination and charge for separate visits of the temple, the museum, etc... Tourists are more than just milk cows that are only good for their money."

At the entry you pay (I think it was 1000 rupees) and then you can either choose a guide or navigate away from the steady stream of young men offering to inform you of the history and culture of the various buildings you’ll see. Since I was there mainly to take photos, and a constant commentary is a distraction, I said no. Once you’re past fifty yards or so of the entrance, you’ll be approached only occasionally. There is a rest room near the entrance (ask at the ticket counter) and it’s the only one I noticed.  Like the durbar squares in Katmandu and Bhaktipur (durbar means “court”), royalty of these ancient kingdoms built palaces to live in and then temples in honor of their gods. Most of the buildings are from the 17th century. The temples are built of red brick and wood and are notable for the use of carved wooden struts to support the roof. Several have stone or metal elephant statues on either side of the staircase in front.  It’s advantageous to follow the map and wander away from the main area to find the temples that are not in the “square” itself. Not all temples stand out. I was walking up an under-construction street far away from the center and asked a man where the Golden Temple was. He pointed up to the next street. I kept on walking and then stopped when he came running up to me and pointed back half way from where I first encountered him. I had to walk almost to the entry to see the way in.  If you’re staying in Thamel you can get to Patan by taxi for about 250-300 rupees. It’s worth half a day or even more. You can climb up the steps of a temple and sit and people-watch or read or just enjoy your leisure time."

One site that was very impressive but just outside the main Square was Mahabuddha Temple where there are according to the locals more than 9,000 stone carvings of Lord Buddha.

There is a museum inside the square and many shopping complexes as well.  In Nepal there are so many religious festivals and one the day that my husband and I visited this place, there was a festival. They played religious music and the women were dressed in red. It will be great if you can visit on a day of a festival as the place is very colourful on such days.  The history of the place is displayed and you can take time to read it and I suggest that you do that because then you get the real feel of what the square was and what it means to the Nepali people. The Hindus believe in Gods and Goddesses in the modern context as well. A young girl who is referred to as 'kumari' that translates as 'princess' stays in the palace in Durbar Sqaure and it is believed that she is a reincarnation of 'Kali'. You will not get an opportunity to see this princess. However, there are so many little temples all over in the square and it is worth a visit."

There were no barriers nor signage indicating that we are indeed entering the square.  A short way into the square and after 2 photos, it was just past 9am, we were stopped by a young lady who asked if we have had tickets. We didn't so we were told to purchase tickets. I went to get my Dad and daughter to go purchase the tickets but my Dad decided not to as he strolled the square yesterday evening and that there is nothing much there. Then, we were approached by the girl's superior (probably), a large young Nepalese. When we said that we have decided that we do not want to purchase the tickets, he got really aggressive, asked us why then are we in the square! (There were no indication of boundary in the first place!!!) Then he told us to leave the square immediately. The girl told him that we have taken photos and told us to delete them! Wow! What a lousy experience.  I mean, I was with my parents who are close to 70 years old and a 11 year old girl, is it necessary to be that rude? It just totally spoiled it for us.  If you have been to Kathmandu Durbar Square, I think you can skip this as this is probably only 30% the size of Kathmandu Square. The entry fee at Kathmandu Square is Nepali Rupee 750 and here it is 500.  Save your money for a nice cup of coffee or tea and avoid spoiling your holiday by a rude gorilla.

Although the square is relatively small, the buildings are intact and so rich in detail as to keep you busy - especially if you're a photographer - for hours.  Roughly speaking, on one side are the royal palace buildings, and on the other side are the various temples, including one in South Indian or 'shikara' style, built of stone and dedicated to the god Krishna. The other wooden temples are in Nepalese architecture, some with erotic carvings on the roof struts. There are also a couple of metal statues on poles in the square, and plenty of details on the buildings to keep the visitor absorbed.  Various architectural styles are presented, with fascinating stories of various features. Pay for a local guide - it's well worth it, as much of the richness of the site is not apparent otherwise.  This is the authentic Nepal before development and traffic made the Kathmandu valley the sorry mess that it now is."

I recomend to devote minimum one day to this historical place. Even if is a public square foreign visitors need to pay entrance, look for the ticket in the counter in one corner of the square. The price is 500 NRP per person. There are also tourist guides, that show you all the details of the temples and palaces in the square. The place is a unique misture of temples, places, the Patan Museum, Cafes, handcraft shops . Go there! Do not miss it!"

Great Architecture!,"We only have 8 days in Nepal. And most of it was spent in Pokhara and trekking to Poon Hill and Annapurna Area. In between, we did shopping in Kathmandhu, Pokhara, Patan and in-between.  Patan Durbar Square is the best place to buy the cheapest and the most number of choices if you are looking for hard-to-find gifts when you return back home. We got traditional ""lunggi"" worn in Bangladesh, India and Nepal. We also brought some ""dhakka topis"", the traditional Nepali hats that are worn by older men. We regret buying a lot of gifts in Pokhara when we found out we can get the exact same type and quality for a much cheaper price here.  In terms of Architecture, you must visit the Patan Museum, although you have to shell our another 250 Nepali Rupees aside from the 200 NP that you paid to enter the square. The architecture and detail in the wood carving in the awnings, door, posts and ceiling is an amazing feat. You can learn a lot from the locals, guides and the information that they have in the museum.  This place is a must for every tourist visiting Nepal. You can get both the best bargains and the most preserved architectural monuments and buildings."

Entry fee is only 200 NPR and ticket is valid for seven days. There is small additional fee for camera, but they will give you sticker which you need to attach to your clothes.  All area is really amazing; I would say the most real and authentic. There are not that many ""local guides"" bothering you like in other places. You have to take your time, enjoy every moment and every detail of this stunning architecture.  Patan Museum is worth seeing, so be ready for a half day trip to Patan. I would say Durbar Square is as well great place to buy local handicraft and souvenirs - prices are more reasonable and things look better.  On the square itself there are few different temples (usually no entry for non-Nepali people) and pagodas. That is exactly you could see Nepal on old pictures. I really like this place and definitely I will spend there more time."

In Bhaktapur and the smallest is in Patan. If your driving from the centre of Kathmandu it's about 30-45 minutes by taxi depending on the traffic. The square itself is similar to the one in Kathmandu although this one has a fresh water spring where the locals go to drink and wash. The area surrounding the square is equally appealing as the square itself, with many places selling very intricate bronze work, some of which is great value for money and some are antique replica's selling for a small fortune. Well worth a trip if however you want to visit only one Durbar Square visit the one in Bhaktapur which in our opinion is the best"

The brownies had a gooey crystallized sugar that for once among the brownies I tasted in Nepal – tasted like a brownie, not some mild chocolate dry cake. But the almond cookies are really what blew me away. I’m Sicilian and my grandmother and mother make cookies like these at the holidays. You only need one; it will fulfill the craving. And upon reading another review I opted to try the thick milkshake though it was cold outside – it was thick and yummy. Now to just expand the milkshake options: cookies and cream, chocolate peanut butter, frozen monkey (coffee, chocolate and banana).

As I live in Kathmandu as an expat, I can say the food and service are consistently very good and it is good value for money. The dish I order most often is the Thali - they call it something different on the menu but ask the waiter or look for the description of various small dishes (cured vegetables, pickle, paneer cheese and rice) served on a platter - vegetarian or meat options available. It is delicious and presentation is super. If you are interested in trying something totally unique drink wise, ask them to demonstrate the pouring of the local Aeyla. The better quality ones Yala serves are actually very smooth to drink - the cheap stuff in other local bars tastes as if it could clean limescale off water pipes. The biggest problem is to find the place. There are no street names and local people don't know it or send you to a different place so here is my recommendation for a wonderful afternoon in Patan which culminates at Yala for dinner! First, visit Patan Durbar Square, a world heritage site of ancient temples and King's palaces. Do stroll around the nearby market - spices, metal items and flowers for temple offerings. After that, use GPS or your tour guide/ local person to get you to the Golden Temple. This is a fantastic temple to visit - one I take all visitors to - it doesn't disappoint. A guide is useful as there is so much crammed into the small courtyard and you could miss and/or misunderstand much of the symbolism. Afterwards, as you exit Golden Temple turn right, stay on this street - and it's a 2 minute walk to Yala. It will be on your left side and there is a freestanding temple structure almost outside it. The sign is easy to miss -- keep a keen eye for the word Yala! Spend your evening enjoying the great food, outdoor candelit dining available, and friendly service. The staff will point you in the direction of the best place to get a taxi. It's easy to get a taxi ""from"" here but not ""to"" here."

Taking its name from the Newari name for Patan, Yala is somewhat hidden away in the corner near the crossroads and narrow lanes in between the Golden Temple and Durbar Square, close to the old town. The manager confirmed to me, as is visible from the outside, that the building has been extensively restored after substantial damage in the earthquake and includes a ground and first-floor shop, selling a range of traditional products and clothing, and a second-floor art gallery which sometimes hosts cultural events with guest speakers. The menu is well-focused on a short range of international dishes all made with fresh ingredients and a wide variety of drinks are available. Yala is a pleasant place to eat and have drinks particularly in the well-maintained garden with candle-lit tables at night with good service and English speaking staff. A must visit on your stay in Patan. I had the spaghetti pomodoro."

An important part of the wellness system is periodic panchakarma, an intense 28-day journey to restore your whole person to your original self (physical, energetic, spiritual, mental, emotional). I have previously completed full panchakarma in northern India (28-days) and small periods in Kerala (5 to 14 days); so, I have some perspective for comparison.  Moksha Ayurveda and Panchakarma Center is an amazing place! The treatments are authentic to the historic model and the facilities are a great holding space to do the work you come to do. The staff, however, is what makes this Center a profoundly healing womb. To a person, they are knowledgeable, compassionate, and deeply caring. They are clearly family to each other and support you in your journey of restoration.  For a single treatment, a short-term stay, or full panchakarma, Moksha Ayurveda has my highest recommendation. I am so very grateful for their nurture and support."

If you’ve never had an Ayurvedic oil bath, you have not fully lived! This exceptional treatment, which is their end-of-panchakarma ritual, is unlike anything I have ever experienced, and I am still walking on air, enjoying a lightness of body, mind and spirit that was my intention and desire when I initially booked the program.  I simply cannot say enough good things about Moksha. A few years ago I’d had a panchakarma elsewhere, but it was not a residential program and this time around I wanted a place to stay where I could fully immerse myself in the experience… and Moksha exceeded all expectations. The first and final word to describe my experience here is “nurturing”. Because Moksha is a small, intimate place (currently only 2 rooms for residential programs although they have plans to expand just slightly to 4 rooms, and many people just come in for day treatments) you are nurtured on every possible level… body, mind, emotion and spirit… and this is the true purpose of a panchakarma, to connect with, purify and heal every aspect of your being.  In retrospect, I really wish I had made more time to do a longer course of treatment, as 7 days really just begins to graze the surface. Regardless, Dr. Padma did a beautiful job of discerning through our consultation what my primary goals and concerns were and addressing them during my week.  The treatments themselves were incredible. They have a staff of practitioners whose caring hearts and hands make sure you are being maximally nurtured during each massage (so many different types!) scrub, cleansing process, chakra healing etc. Even the necessary but more unpleasant treatments were done with ultimate care and there was nothing that felt routine about any of it. Each moment felt as if it was being done and given to me for my specific needs and particular specifications. I felt deeply cared for.  And then there was Sanjay. Each morning I had two hours of personalized yoga and pranayama as well as some beautiful discussion time about philosophy (yoga and life) and as a yoga instructor back home, this was particularly impactful for me. He is an incredible teacher with a wealth of knowledge, but perhaps more importantly, his energy is as warm and pure as it gets. My time with him in conjunction with the cleansing and purifying treatments themselves was exactly what I needed at that moment in time, as I had just come to the center after a particularly impactful spiritual journey and needed the appropriate space and support to help me integrate the experience.  The food… what can I say. It is authentic Ayurvedic food cooked with love, specifically for your needs to nurture you from the inside out. Delicious.  The center itself (treatment rooms, residence, reception, dining area etc) is impeccably clean and the rest of the support staff was also exceptional, helping in any way possible to make my stay more pleasant. On the morning of my departure Sanjay made sure I had food before my early morning flight and some extra apples for me to take on my journey… so sweet. The whole experience was incredibly personal and touching and I can’t remember ever being so attentively cared for in this way.  Leaving the center and in the days following, I feel so incredibly good. The Ayurvedic system of treating and caring for the entire human system… mind, body and spirit… is highly effective if done right. If you are thinking about doing a panchakarma or getting any sort of Ayurvedic care, it is well worth your while to come to Kathmandu and spend your time and money at Moksha, and after being there, I wouldn’t dream of getting Ayurvedic therapy anywhere else. There is absolutely no question that I will be back, and I look forward to it. Thank you Moksha team… you are all a real blessing."

I came in to treat my chronic back pain and nasal congestion, and I came out 10 days later with both of these illnesses cured as well as feeling completely relaxed and ready to conquer the world. Each day, they checked in with me about my progress and did everything they could to make me feel happy and relaxed. They treat you like family at Moksha. Dr Padma is a very kind, knowledgeable doctor and she answered all of my questions with ease and non judgment. The yoga and pranayama exercises in the morning with Sanjay worked very well with my treatments. The massage therapists gave the absolute BEST massages I've ever had. The food was extremely delicious, healthy, and made specifically for my dosha. The treatments I received were all hygienically prepared, using only fresh herbs. Dr Padma did an excellent job explaining all the procedures, describing my dosha, and giving me advice for the future. I highly recommend Moksha Ayurveda for anyone considering Panchakarma. Even if you come in for just a massage, you will not be disappointed. They offer many different packages to suit your needs. I will definitely be back once more before I leave Nepal."

Length: 10 days.  In short, Moksha are the best. The communication with Moksha via email while arranging your trip is quick, they send you an approximate program and price list per your request. They meet you at the Airport and bring you to the Center. You talk to Dr. Padma and she defines your body type and the treatment program. And the treatment starts. You live in a room right there in the villa. They make the meals on the spot. I was there in July, the “rainy” season with the cloudy sky and the daily temperature of 26 C. Not a bad time to come to Nepal. The Center is a villa with a garden, located in a quiet street of Lalitpur, a satellite city of Kathmandu. Taking into account the dirt, dust and terrible roads/streets of Kathmandu, this may be a plus. Lalitpur is cleaner than Kathmandu. The team are: Dr. Padma, Mr. Sanjay – yoga instructor and Ayurveda practitioner (he is such a cool guy), Nirajan – the manager and arranger of all things, Mr. Ram and two young men, Santosh and Milan – Ayurveda practitioners and masseurs. There are also several young ladies who do procedures to ladies. The cleanliness and hygienic norms at the Center are excellent. The procedure rooms, the procedures themselves, the oils, the towels, everything meets the highest hygienic standards. They take everything seriously: they are well equipped for the procedures and follow some strict rules. Ram, Santosh and Milan are excellent masseurs with strong hands who give the best oil massage. The massages they provide are very intense and tough but you can ask and regulate the intensity at any time. The massages are performed according to some principles which are beyond my competence: the hand movements along flows of energy in the body etc. The massage may last for two hours and even longer. They take it very seriously. In general, the whole team takes their work very seriously. If they do, they do it good. The procedures are lengthy, performed thoroughly, at a price much lower than probably anywhere in the world. The Center provides the comprehensive range of Ayurveda procedures (the list is available on their site). The basis is various oil massages plus daily yoga and pranayama classes. There are procedures such as synchronized 4-arm whole body oil massage and scrub with ginger and rice powder, or a massage with constantly flowing hot oil performed by six masseurs. Another procedure is Netra Tarpana: they pour oil on a patient’s open eyes. Although this may contradict the modern medicine, the improvement for my eyesight is obvious for me. Every morning you also take some minor procedures such as neti (nose cleansing). At the end of the treatment, they sell you some medicines to take home. Not much, not expensive. Minuses: First: the meals are a disaster. What is even worse is that the meals during the diet periods become scarce. You might have to request proper meals or go outside and eat properly on your own. Second: the rooms do not meet the criteria of comfort in the Western standards. One might consider living in some hotel nearby and coming to Moksha for procedures only."

First I met the doctor and it was very good meeting. I got lifestyle advices plus yoga and pranayama teaching. In December I spent 10 days there with classical panchakarma treatments. It was once in a lifetime experience and I felt so much better after the panchakarma program. People in the center were lovely and they treated me very well. I got pure and healthy Ayurveda meals plus clean and homey private room (with a comfortable bed) next to the rooftop. All the treatments were very relaxing. I also got yoga and pranayama teaching during the panchakarma program. Now, 4 months later, I'm still continuing the practices because they help me to feel energetic and peaceful.  It was a gift from me to myself that I walked into Moksha Ayurveda and Panchakarma Center. I learned a lot about my body, mind and soul and I had an opportunity to meet genuine people who are like family to me now. They helped me to love myself and share the love with other beings. This place offers healing environment, treatments and meetings for the people who's willing to feel more alive. I'm happy that I went there and I can warmly recommend it for everyone. Go and experience ღ  See you again in full panchakarma session!"

The team is competent, friendly and genuinely caring. Both of us have never experienced better massages. My boyfriend is in owe of Ram's skills, for example, but this knowledge applies to all other therapists too. The therapies and food are pure healing for the spirit, body and mind with very strong positive effects. They are both individualized, after a thorough consultation, and are adjusted based on the experience of the guest. The place itself is a small island of peace, perfect for contemplation, relaxation and internal silence. We enjoyed absolutely everything and would love to go back there as soon as possible. Thank you, Moksha team, you are all very special people running a very special place :) Big hugs, Denitsa and Denis"

Nestled behind a villa, is the school with a perfect set up. We were not interested in going to someone's house to learn to cook and this is an actual set up where everyone has their own cooking station.  As mentioned, there are a variety of menus to choose from and I found Shusma to be helpful, encouraging, and very patient. Making the very popular Momos is not as easy as one would think.  I definitely had a fun afternoon and would highly recommend this experience. It makes me want to do this everywhere I go, but I suspect this is a hard act to follow.

Shusma is a great teacher and goes through every step to make the perfect Nepali dishes. We even went to the local grocery shop to buy the ingredients before, where Shusma showed and explained to me the different vegetables and what they're used for. This gave me a real insight into Nepalese cooking. You are also given so much flexibility to choose the dishes you want to make (starter, main and desert). Finally a percentage of money she makes at the cookery classes goes into Women's empowerment- so definitely talk to Shusma about this as she gave me so much insight into the caste system, gender equality and what it means to be a women in Nepal."

It started with choosing a menu made of three dishes, after that we went to a local market buying the products that we needed and then the fun began. First I got to learn how to make the traditional Masala Tea and after our cup of tea, the preparation of the dishes started. We had a lot of fun making Chatamari, Aloo Chop and chocolate Mo:Mo, talking, joking around and laughing. After each dish you can eat the foods outside in the beautiful garden and just be amazed by how good it tastes! Finally, they send you all the recipes of the day and more, so that you can cook them again at home. The place is really clean and I love that they put a lot of emphasize on not trying to waste any food. I left the class with a full belly, good memories and a new friend!

It was confusing. Wasn't terrible so I ate it, but it was disappointing.  Also had fries, which were suuuuper oily but nonetheless crunchy. Average.  Custard filled donuts were also average.

Very nice and relaxed outside seating on a terasse with bamboo roof. Friendly and attentive staff. Good variety of food on the menu. Just about the right amount of dishes to choose from. To cut it short, the taste of the food is really very good, and authentic. I have lived in Japan for ten years and can say, it is also pretty authentic, which you unfortunately will find only very seldomly. The yummy taste is up to the Japanese patron who continuously supervises the kitchen staff in the proper preparation of the dishes.  From what we had we would especially recommend the tofu steak (if you like Japanese tofu), really very original and tasty, however you will not get a big bunch of grilled tofu as 'steak' in Japan..The tempura was coming as a large portion, vegetables and the shrimps were very fresh, prepared in most fresh oil. The homemade udon noodles were nice, but a little bit too soft. Finally try the gyoza. Both, the chicken an the pork (even better) gyoza are extremely tasty!  Eat there and you not be disappointed !"

I am a regular customer coming almost every week and have tried pretty much everything of their very diverse menu. The food has that very authentic taste and offers a very subtle harmony between carefully prepared home-cooked food and delicate gourmet cuisine, with just the right balance of spices. They also serve delicious side achaar (spices) with every meal, my personal favorite being the lapsi (Nepali plum). The quality is always constant, I have never been disappointed a single time. It's probably one of the best Nepali restaurant in town and definitely my personal favorite one!  But it's not only the great food that makes me come back again and again. It is also about the place and its people. The friendly owner and the smiling staff are very attentive and always give me a warm feeling of being taken care of. The restaurant is also decorated with taste and exudes a very pleasant atmosphere. There is a sort of discrete elegance, refinement in simplicity, at Achaar Ghar which makes it a truly special place for a unique culinary experience. A must!"

We both had the same thought as we walked directly to the newish Southern Comfort restaurant near Saint Mary’s school without our usual discussion about where we want to lunch.  Southern Comfort’s menu is all American. Burgers, onion rings, Caesar salad, chicken-fried steak, biscuits and gravy. You get the idea. We ordered onion rings and a burger with chilies and cheese. The establishment’s owner stopped by and explained that to get a true American flavor he had to make many of the items we take for granted from scratch. He and his staff bake the hamburger buns, produce their own mayonnaise and home make the ranch dressing. The results are nothing short of spectacular for Nepal.  The onion rings were the first we’ve had during our two years in Nepal and the burger the best we’ve tasted in Kathmandu. Southern Comfort’s got all the American details just right. Our beer was even served ice cold in a frosty mug. Welcome home."

The restaurant holds to a very high quality in service and food quality.  It's a small place, but a few cute tables and chairs set with wine glasses, plates, and cutlery are scattered around as well as two conversation areas with lounge chairs.  My personal favorite is the spaghetti with pesto. It's on the ""lunch"" menu, but you can order it for dinner as well. This is some of the best pesto anywhere. I've had it more than a dozen times easily. Only once (years ago) was it a little subpar. Every other time it's come out fresh, hot, aromatic, and flavorful!  I also like the Rock Shrimp Tempura appetizer. The shrimp have been frozen, though. (After all this in Nepal and we're very far from ocean!). So if that bothers you, don't order them.  The desserts are great, though I'm usually too full to order one.  The owner is Nepali who has studied abroad. He clearly has an interest in French cooking (and the menu is French-inspired), though he works in information technology. If he's in, you can even order in French (if you'd like). Otherwise, you'll need to stick with English (or Nepali, of course).  They always seem quite happy to see me when I'm in town and stop by. It's a little off the main street, so they don't get a lot of foot traffic. More NGO and UN workers than tourists (it's right across from the U.N. gate in Patan.  Highly recommended."

It was so shockingly warm and cheerful that we may not have cared if the food was not satisfying. However, our dinner was absolutely delicious. I am a vegetarian and I haven't had a more sumptuous meal in the last week in Nepal than at Cibo Bistro. Their vegetarian lasagne was probably the best I have had anywhere. The bruschetta had so much flavour; grilled slices of eggplant, zucchini and tomato are layered over bread, and splashed with just the right amounts of basil pesto and mozzarella. My fiancé had the gnocchi with the house wine and some apple pie for dessert (I was too full from the lasagne for any dessert). Coffee was pretty good too. Cibo's service is very helpful and quick.  In short, this is a restaurant that offers excellent and varied food in a decent price range and guilt-inducing comfort in a power-starved city."

It is a special temple with over 9,000 terracotta carvings of Buddha. I believe the original temple was destroyed and rebuilt after the large earthquake that rocked Nepal back in the 1940's. Some of the rubble was used to build a temple to honour Buddha's mother which is in the same area. It is certainly worth the visit."

I made an appointment a few hours earlier, but I suppose it is also OK to just drop in.  The clinic is in the top floor of a building near Hotel Himalaya and the Swedish Embassy, quite easy to find. Everyone was very welcoming when I arrived and it is a very professional place. Lulu was my masseur for the day. She is a really friendly and open young women. I could relax easily when she started the massage. I had a full body swedish massage. She kept asking from time to time if the pressure was alright and asked me to honest about this. She worked her hands around my many knots at my back and even found a blockade that hardly any masseur found so far (just my physical therapist at home). After the massage I felt much more at ease though my neck was still hurting. Today, not even 24 hours later, I feel so much better and relaxed thanks to Lulu and her magical hands.  I actually found it quite difficult to find a decent place to go for a massage in Kathmandu. It is quite different from places like Thailand where it is somehow easier and also a litte less expensive. But I am very happy to have found the Seeing Hands Clinic and to have met Lulu. I am surely coming back for another massage with Lulu."

The food was good. I had ordered the North Eastern set which was of decent proportions and of value for money. Although i would have preferred the chicken to be boneless and more grilled it neverthough tasted good. I totally loved the papaya salad that came along in the set. One of the best i have had in a very long time. The ambience is very modern and i just wished it would have reflected more of traditional Thailand. Nevertheless it is a good place and i would definitely visit again.

In fact I only have to call 2-4 times then one of the staff came with ice and apologised after I shouted. They could see the baby crying so badly management were not even bother to ask if everything ok with baby. After an small arguments with one of the staff, he told me they just washed the high chair so baby felt down. How can people be so negligible.

This was a real highlight during my time in Patan. Upon walking through the gate leading to the courtyard, I was taken back into time with the sight of the gilded shrine in the middle of the courtyard. The shrine was well maintained with great detail. Even more ornate were the doorway and arches at the Temple. As I looked closer at the center arch/doorway, I saw something hanging from the arch and spatters of something against the nearby wall. I was informed that entrails from a water buffalo were hanging from the arch as part of a sacrifice. The spatters were blood from the same water buffalo.  A part of the Taleju Mandir Temple complex was the Sundari Cok. This was a smaller courtyard, the centerpiece of which was a inground pool type area that was circled by ornate carvings with a very detailed gilded statue in the front center of the “pool.’ It was inspiring to see how well much of this temple, including Sundari Cok withstood the impact of the 2015 earthquake."

The feeling of being the only two visitors to the large open square, Villagers herding their ducks and goats through the old temple grounds actually added to the experience. I have always been a big archeology fan, so ruins excite me. These are relatively new, caused by a natural disaster, not time, although the original temples were in the 6-700 year old range. Visiting here is more of an exploration into the past. If a bunch of broken stones doesn't excite you much, I would skip this site. There's a lot of history , hundreds of small temples in the Kathmandu valley to explore. Most of the old shops and restaurants are gone, there is still one wood carver left here, turning out some beautiful HIndu and Bhuddist Statuary out of ancient pieces of wood that he imports from the Langtang region of Nepal. Worth the trip just to visit his shop."

An old house, a yard converted to an enclosed garden, a hip new wing with well-dressed tables and a bar. Shazam! Family house becomes restaurant.  Some months ago, my wife and I watched an old house transform into Embers, hip new Krishna Galli restaurant. Embers even sports a few designer stores in front to complete the image.  On a recent Saturday, our grocery shopping finished, we headed to Embers for lunch. This was not our first time at the spot and we headed directly for the new wing and its enclosed dining room to escape a late winter rainstorm. The folk that put Embers together followed the model faithfully. The new wing is stylish with floor to ceiling windows with bar at one end, the courtyard surrounded by fountain, the bar a classic Newari design and the house a warren of private rooms with show kitchen open to the courtyard.  After a quick glance at the menu, we ordered an Embers salad and chicken burger. The menu has a familiar mix of western and nepali main dishes and snacks. As we sipped our three for the price of two Carlsbergs, we watched a waiter collect cushions from the courtyard chairs. Two other couples sipped wine and nibbled on snacks. It’s unusual to see a lot of business at local eateries early on a Saturday afternoon, but Embers was doing just fine.  Our salad arrived first and we dug in. Crisp greens, sun dried tomatoes and boiled eggs made for a welcome start to our lunch. The outdoor bar was decorated for a party as it had been on several of our previous trips to Embers. Unlike many Kathmandu restaurants that turn into catering venues on a moments’ notice, Embers seems to have figured out how to keep the two lines of work separate. Our salad finished and the plate cleared, the chicken burger landed. Multigrain bun, crispy lettuce and previously frozen fries filled the plate.  All in all, Embers is a pleasant place to grab a drink, snack or dinner. It fits its category well and is just fine."

During my visit, I was given an comprehensive display of the history and use of the singing bowls. These bowls are said to help aid in minimizing minor aches in the body. This is done in part by helping the user to relax and focus. The sizes of the bowls range from smaller to large enough to stand in. I purchased a smaller bowl and was please to be advised that the purchase included a cushion and two mallet; one of the mallets is used to circle the bowl until it rings, the second is used to “hammer” the bowl. I was able to have the items mailed to me in the United States; I received the shipment shortly after my return home in perfect condition. Also included was a set of instructions.  While the items in this showroom are more expensive than the items offered by street vendors, it is easy to tell that these items are authentic pieces and not just for souvenir collection. I found the prices to be fair and left with the knowledge that I was assisting a business in Patan that was hit hard by the earthquake."

Loved it.,"Staying at Om's Apartments (which is just above Om Handicrafts) was an absolute pleasure. It was beautifully appointed, clean, comfortable, warm and safe. Also it is situated in a very beautiful part of Kathmandu. Our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children age 10 and 6) were most perfectly accommodated in 2 separate apartments. Though we ate out a lot, there is a clean and well equipped kitchen upstairs. The staff are both warm and professional. My children loved going downstairs to Om's Handicrafts to see their exquisite singing bowls and to chat to them and to listen to the magnificent sounds. Manoj, Abhi and Raaz were always available to answer questions and to help us. By the end of our stay I was very sad to leave such special people and a place that housed us so well. My only regret is not buying more singing bowls. They are truly therapeutic and make for wonderful gifts also."

There are a handful of stores that I believe a Westerner would be interested in stopping by: Dukati (prices were really reasonable), Yala (had some luxury bath products and nice jewelry), Om, Sala (I was most enchanted with their blanket wool rugs as these would sell for over $1k in the US – NYC to be specific.) I’ll say, I found Om Handicrafts to be a bit sterile and at Western-like prices. Now did I buy something, yes, yes I did. I had wanted a 100% pure cashmere blanket and I thought in the United States these could range in the $400-800 price range depending on where you purchased. These at Om are part of a fair trade organization (which I prefer to support) and they had a masculine design to them (and I liked the chevron/herringbone/striped patterns in neutrals.) I paid $247 for a double bed size blanket (more for the couch in my particular opinion) and opted for a 4x4 weave. The less expensive weaves can be 1x1 (super thin) or 2x1 (medium to light weight and not as long or wide.) I will also say that the scarves that they offered are the same price as at Kopan monastery and look identical. And now that I have my blanket home, I'm disappointed to say that the edges are starting to show loose/frayed threads that are coming out of the blanket."

My wife and I have lived in Kathmandu for a little over a year now and when I decided to take off a recent Friday to make a long weekend, I was certain the October weather would be fine. I was wrong. The monsoon, that a few days before seemed to have dissipated, was back. A steady rain settled in making our planned excursion to the Kopan Monastery problematic. When the veil of rain still hadn’t lifted by 11:30 Saturday morning, we scrubbed our plans and headed to lunch.  We visited GG Machaan several months ago and I remembered it as having a pleasant, covered outdoor terrace which made it a good candidate for lunch on a rainy day. We arrived at 12:15 after a short drive and were immediately seated. My memory was correct. The two level outdoor terrace is bamboo covered and sports photos of Nepali royalty hunting for big game in times long past. The menu contains predominantly Nepali snacks but also a mix of western fare and Indian food.  After a brief perusal of the menu, we settled on Perale mushrooms (oyster mushrooms battered w/Benal gram flower, green chili, garlic) and the GG fried Basa fish. The waiter capably took our order and read everything back to make sure he had it correct. While we waited for our order to arrive, I tapped my foot to cover versions of popular tunes played in the background. After a reasonable wait, the mushrooms arrived. What was immediately noticeable to us was that the chef had clearly considered the presentation of this simple dish. In most restaurants around town, food is unceremoniously dumped on the plate. Here, the main dish was carefully plated and garnished with carved vegetables. Nice! The taste was as good as the presentation.  No sooner had we polished off the mushrooms than the fish arrived. The presentation of golden-fried chunks of Basa fish equaled that of the now disappeared mushrooms. The Basa fish soon suffered the same fate. As we lingered on the quiet terrace enjoying a rainy afternoon it was clear to us that we had chosen wisely.  While GG Machaan is no jungle, it is a place for good food, well presented in comfortable surroundings."

The menu is decent and the staff is nice. So far so good. The problem is that every second time we have made an order, half of the things did't come. Since the food often take 25-40 minutes to be made, you get a little frustrated that only 3 of 4 people get their food. This have happened several times! When the restaurant is full and crowded and when there is just a handful of guests.  Another thing that really reduce my willingness to visit Evoke on weekends is that they have live music which is supposed to be nice? At Evoke they have it so loud that it hurts.

At local terms meat is an animal randomly hacked to death, probably even abused before going for the jugular and then just piled the flesh in a heap to cut as per weight, so requesting for a shank or a tenderloin or asking its a veal buff or anything else would be klingon.  Then steps in Grill me, this was a complete set up by the co-owner Anudaan to have me sucked into this place where I was invited for a meeting which discussion feels like a motion blur after gorging on the spread.  The chilly prawns were to die for, subtly spicy with the right amount of flavors and the quality was just perfect considering it was frozen before, the baby back ribs fried were a perfect snack again, never dripped any oil well flavored with chilli soy dip and the highlight was the collection of single malt's which were handpicked by the owners themselves deviating way ahead from the general speyside regulars.  Viola... time for dinner!!...  Apprehensive me only indulged on the commonest of all steaks 'the tenderloin with commonest of all sauces 'the pepper sauce as my previous experiences were like a one night stand in Bangkok were you ask for a doughnut and get served a sausage. lo and behold the meat arrives on the table i get my steaks medium rare with the juices dripping and pink in the centre. It was a sensation where you hear violins in the background as the knife cut through the meat... perfect to the core and so was the sauce... a match made in heaven... served with mashed potatoes and sauted veggies were like the page boy and the flower girl in the tow!!  Finishing the meal and kept me craving for the next visit... inquired about how could they get the meat so right... got to know it came from the Nina-Hager stable which supposedly master the art of meat cuts.  Nevertheless, I would strongly recommend the place to every steak fanatic in the Nepal to give it a peak."

(Ask for gu","We recently returned to the US from the trip of a lifetime in Nepal, organized by Trekking Guide Team Adventure. We started with the Everest Base Camp trek, traveled to Chitwan, then spent a few days in Pokhara. Kabi, the owner and organizer, couldn't have been more professional. He always listened to our wants and needs and always made them happen. He was extremely flexible even when we wanted to change details of our trip on the spot. For example, when going to Chitwan we originally were going to take a tourist bus. We decided we'd rather go by private car(i highly recommend) Kabi arranged us a car and a driver for the entire journey. I can't say enough great things about Kabis professionalism, flexibility, and genuine desire to make our adventure perfect. He succeeded!! Our guide for EBC was Shambu Basnet. This man was one of the main reasons our trip was so enjoyable and successful. He took on several roles on top of being our guide. He arranged for excellent lodging along the trek, made sure our food was wonderful, checked our vitals at high altitude, if we were struggling he was right there to help. He was extremely well knowledgeable and informative regarding the trek, the mountains, the wildlife, and the people and different cultures of Nepal. If you need a guide, you can't do any better than Shambu. I'd trust my life to him any day. He made sure our safety was a number one concern. We were so impressed by Shambu we asked him to join us as our guide after the trek to Chitwan and Pokhara. He graciously accepted and obliged and we are glad he did. Not one part of this trip would have been as enjoyable or educational without Shambu. He too was flexible, if we needed anything...Shambu always went above and beyond to make it happen! We may have started as client and guide but now, thankfully we leave friends forever!!! If you're looking for a trekking or travel agency to help with your trip to Nepal, look no further than Kabi and Trekking Guide Team Adventure. They have a myriad of treks, excursions, and experiences for you to choose from. You won't be disappointed. Kabi, Shambu, and all of the staff at Trekking Guide Team Adventure take customer service to another level. If you're in need of a guide, request Shambu Basnet. Again, you won't be disappointed."

Booking was easy and Kabi is very responsive to any queries before arriving to Kathmandu.  We were assigned Kris as our guide (who is very experienced and has been trekking this course for roughly 37 years) and he took great care in making sure we had a great experience during the trek. Any concerns we had were addressed and he made sure that everyone made it to EBC in a very safe and comfortable way. He also made sure we were mentally prepared for each walk and that we ate well (especially for me, as I lost my appetite due to altitude). The accommodation were all booked in tea houses which were comfortable for us trekkers, it added to the experience as most nights we were in the main room playing cards and sharing stories.  We had a few extra days and booked the Chitwan Jungle Safari which added to the fun and wonderful experience in Nepal. I really recommend this if you have a few days to spare.

Our main guide Kris has decades of guiding experience and was able to determine the level of attention and care required for each of the 10 trekkers in our group. The trek is arduous and does require a certain level of stamina and fitness to achieve the end goal. We did very limited pre-trek training and would have benefitted from a few weeks or months in the gym (squats and leg strengthening would have been most helpful), nevertheless we endured and conquered.

After researching for the best and local trekking company in Kathmandu, Nepal I came across to Nepal Hiking Adventure. I found them were very honest, kind and helpful. I came to Nepal alone but there was a person from the agency who dropped me to my hotel. Later, he took me to his office and I came to know he was my guide for my trip to Everest Base Camp trek. This am a solo travelers but I was requested for group join trek for EBC, NHA has prepared a small group of people from different world, it was a great to meet different people for the trek. We had a small meeting with Bishnu, the managing director and Ram our tour guide. Bishnu brief everything regarding the trip. After that, Ram suggest me best cafes and restaurants nearby my hotel for tasting authentic Nepalese cuisine. Since, I visited Nepal alone they introduce me to wonderful groups of people around as well. Trekking with them was just amazing. We all were visiting Nepal for the first time as well as trekking in Everest but our tour guides and porters make this trip easy, fun, exciting and very memorable. I was truly amazed by our porters Chiring and Lakpa, they were carrying heavy loads of bags on a steep rough pathway whereas we were getting breathless even we were carrying a light backpack.  Throughout the trek, we talk about our personal life stories and learn a lot things about this region. The views from Everest Base camp and Kala Patthar is beyond any imagination which gives you the feelings that Heaven exists in the form of Himalayas. A big thank you to our guide, porters and other Nepal Hiking Adventure team for making my journey everlasting. I will never forget this adventurous journey I took with an amazing group of people. I suggest people to take physical and mental training before starting this trek as it can be very helpful while trekking long distance. I can’t forget this especially at last I would recommend Nepal Hiking Adventure to those who wants best services as this company truly offers high quality services."

The trip organiser Bishnu made everything so convenient and easy from start to finish. From the initial email he helped plan the trip tailored to what my friend and I wanted. The hotels were really beautiful and the food was amazing. We went to all the main tourist attractions in Kathmandu,we hiked to and from Naktapur as well as stopping off at an old temple, as well as having the traditional Nepalese meal and party it was very cool. Overall it was a brill trip and the tour guides and organiser were brilliant throughout the whole trip. I would HIGHLY recommend using this company."

The tour organizer (Bishnu) had everything arranged perfectly and in just 6 days we saw all the highlights of Kathmandu (temples, markets etc), went white-water rafting, stayed in the jungle which included an elephant ride, a canoe trip on the river and a trek through the jungle, a cultural dance performance, a hike up Nagarkot with sunset and sunrise views of the Himalayas, a tour of the amazing Bhaktapur and finally a night at a traditional Nepalese restaurant tasting some of the delicious local dishes. Simply amazing. I can not recommend this company and Bishnu high enough. The perfect tour guide and company."

We were promptly and warmly met at the airport by the owner who then escorted us back to a good hotel, with clean beds and warm running showers (which is quite a rare commodity in Kathmandu). Starting the trek entailed a lengthy bus trip to Jiri from Kathmandu, which isn't kind on the legs but is very scenic. Even on this bus trip we were welcomed in eating with our guide in the actual kitchens of people's homes, as opposed to cafeterias - which gave us an insight into Nepali life that I'm happy to say continued to be privileged us throughout our trek.  Trekking to Base Camp from Jiri is the only way to do it and if you have the fitness (it is occasionally gruelling) and time, then you HAVE to do it this way. There are fewer people trekking, you get to spend more time with the people (as they are generally more receptive to you sitting in their kitchens when there are fewer tourists), and the scenery is just remarkable. At all points our guides and porters were really supportive and attentive to our needs, and were keen to show us the interesting bits of the various cultures.  It was in the ability of Nepal Trekking to deal with emergencies, however, that really showed the quality of their guides and porters, and the quality of the company as a whole. I was stricken with AMS (acute mountain sickness) at Lobuche and became really ill, really suddenly. As a result of the disorientation I lacked the wherewithal to realise I was dangerously sick and so I probably would have continued trekking. Our guide, however, really took control of the situation - which is exactly what you need in what is definitely a high-risk scenario. He quickly spoke with the owner (who was based in Kathmandu) who then quickly mediated with our insurance company and had an emergency helicopter scrambled for us. The care and concern I was shown by the guide and porter (and indeed many of the other guides and porters convened at Lobuche) was indeed touching and was a further credit to them and the company. The decision and rapid action of the company prevented the situation becoming severe, and I thank and commend them for that.  Overall, the owner, the guide and our porter were a pleasure to be around and took care of everything, and our safety and comfort were always their paramount concerns. In a city that fiercely competes for your custom, I couldn't recommend Nepal Hiking in stronger or warmer terms."

They were a wonderful group to see this city and area with. I did this tour on my second day. After the hustle and bustle of the city centre it was wonderful to get out to these two fabulous UNESCO World Heritage Sites!! We went to Patan first - it was wonderful ! Every angle was picture perfect - postcard scenes !! Then we went to Bhaktapur.... so beautiful that several weddings were being held there ! Again picture perfect !! My wonderful tour guide (Som B) shared a wealth of knowledge over 3 days and always answered my questions fully. I also want to commend my driver ( Suman T) who kept my possessions safe while I toured with Som and allowed me to feel safe in an area of thousands of hectic drivers!! These two were a great team who always arrived early and ensured my safe return at the end of each day - they went above and beyond. Special Note: I was touring when the Virus CoV19 changed the world and this team and the CEO of the Himalayan Planet (Nabaraj T) assisted getting me out of the country amid chaos and confusion. They went above and beyond providing me assistance. KNOW you are in GOOD HANDS when you tour with this company ! I would also suggest any travellers still in Nepal use this group to get yourselves out... I understand they are not doing tours during this crisis but I am sure you could pay them to assist you in exiting Nepal... if anyone can do it they can !

The hike through Nagarkot was beautiful and our guide was super knowledgable of all the different cultures and traditions in the local area, he really made the day special. What was also amazing about him was that whilst by the end of the day my boots (and bum) were covered in mud, our guides shoes was spotless! After a downpour the day before I honestly don't know how he did it. Worth noting here that the local Nepalese on the tour were all lovely, friendly and happy to share their landscape - and even helped me get clean after a tumble into a puddle.  Our guide gave us the option to hike for a further two hours through the jungle after the first two hours, which we happily accepted - it was so worth it.  The Hindu temple at the end of the hike was great - dating back to 300 AD! The way that it has been restored is a testament to the skills of the local people as it has really kept its authenticity.  Needless to say, the sunrise coming up over the Himalayas was stunning, truly breakth-taking.  What was especially great about this tour was the private nature - no tour bus, just us and our private guide!!  Remember to take warm clothes for the morning and that can be stripped off for the heat of the afternoon. Also, remember $15 for breakfast at a mountainside resort."
