But there's more: the Golden Temple and the terra cotta temple of Mahabouddha. By this time we were pretty much exhausted after three weeks of none stop travel.

The designs on the wooden columns and window frames are really intricate if not painstakingly done.  The place is really a cultural complex worthy of our time and attention."

Entry to the museum is included in the price of Durbar Square ticket (1,000 rupees for foreigner). You need an hour or two to cover all of it comprehensively as all the artefacts have brief explanations next to them. What I found particularly interesting were explanations of sitting down positions and hand gestures of statues on a display as well as background information of religion. Second floor offers lovely view of Durbar Square and interior courtyard from the balcony. It also has a cafe and a gift shop."

As an interested atheist it explained to me the different Buddhist deities and the meanings of assorted head, hand and body postures in statues etc as well as a historical overview of the faith generally. It is a joint venture between the governments of Austra and Nepal and as such benefits from a large injection of hard currency. It is well-labelled and laid-out and clear descritions in several languages help the visitor. Cafe also nice and this is set amidst lovely gardens with an English feel.

I went twice and lost power one day at 11am and the next at 12pm. It is difficult to see the exhibits and read the descriptions when it's dark.

At Patan Museum all of the information is in English and is very detailed. The museum focuses on the history of Hinduism and Buddhism in Patan and has lots of interesting statues. There is two parts to the museum both included in the ticket price of 400 rupees. While the main museum through the golden door is intact the second half through a neighbouring door off the main square has had some damage from the earthquake but this doesn't seem to have had much in it anyway. Definitely make a visit here.  Tip: I paid 1000 rupees for a guide as I wandered into patan square, and apart from showing me where the golden temple is he wasn't worth the price (though he was a nice person). Definitely don't get a guide for the museum as I saw one person being shown round quickly by the guide and he didn't see much of the exhibits. Do it at your own speed."

On my first visit you could climb all the way up in the corner towers for a birds eye view of the square, but that was not accessible this visit. Good restaurant in the courtyard.

Duck through the door in the middle of Dhurbar Square in Patan and enter into the museum courtyard. A second courtyard door takes you into the garden area and to the entrance stairs leading up to the exhibits. The place is exquisite, and done in typical Newari style.  Here, laid out in a very manageable format, is an incredible lesson in Buddhist and Hindu iconography, shown through a carefully chosen and exhibited selection of bronzes. One can either just enjoy a superficial view of some of the best bronzes or really learn about the attributes and symbolism of the different gods and goddesses that people the country of Nepal. Descriptions of the figures and pictured are clear and concise. The museum is relatively small, so the visitor is not overwhelmed by too many things to see.  Below in the courtyard the garden outside is a small restaurant, with tables tastefully placed under trees, near flowers or under a covered roof area. Food is fine - not overly gourmet - but an okay combination of Nepali (geared to non-spicy tastes) and western fare. Service is friendly, but can be slow, so be prepared. It helps to have a reservation during the busy lunch hours."

Once inside, the museum rooms are spread around two or three floors of the old palace complex. They overlook a central coutyard that had a small stupa in it. All the exhibitions were beautifully set-up and well illuminated. There were very informative placards for each exhibit, so one can learn a lot here. We spent at least two hours viewing the exhibitions. I'd also recommend the museum guidebook, which was beautifully photographed. The museum shops were also attractive, as was the very pleasant museum cafe. If you're in Patan, the museum is a must. If you're near Patan, a visit to this museum is almost a reason in itself for visiting Patan."

You can see by the architecture and building layout that the city was very wealthy during it's day. Even now the buildings have been restored to their original elegance. Of particular note is the Ancient Royal Palace that includes meticulous carvings and reflects the architecture of the ancient Newar peoples. There are a variety of temples to visit and explore throughout Patan while wandering along the side streets."

It is easy to come from Kathmandu which we did a day trip combined with Bhaktapur Durbar Square for a morning half day trip for about 6 hours (including 1 hour lunch) with a negotiated price arranged with taxi driver through our hotel - Bodhi Boutique Hotel at Thamel district. The taxi fare for the entire trip was NPR 2,500 for the entire 6 hours. After double checked with hotel staff for the rough guide of taxi fare, single trip from Thamel to Baktapur cost NPR 1,000 (45 mins journey) and single trip from Baktapur to Patan is NPR500-600 (35 mins journey) plus single trip from Patan to Kathmandu is NPR500 (20 mins journey). Hence, the additional NPR400-500 is for the waiting time, depending on negotiation with driver. Unlike Baktapur Durbar Square, there are many entry points to Patan Durbar Square since the square is not fully fenced. There will be many security personnels with uniforms walking around to identify foreign tourists and bring them to ticketing office to pay for the tickets that cost NPR 1,000 per person per entry. We thought it was a scam initially, but soon we discovered that it is how it works when visiting to Patan Durbar Square. Locals are allowed to enter the square free of charge. The entrance fee is inclusive of the museum right in front of the square with good introduction and information about Hinduism history and culture in Patan (Latlipur). There are some interesting collections of the Hindu and Buddhist Gods statues, such as Shiva, Krishna, etc. The Square was a typical Newar Achitecture with beautiful wooden carvings, Hindu idols, etc. One of the highlights is the ancient royal palace where Malla Kings of Latlipur resided. We also saw the local devotees carried out the prayer rituals which was an interesting cultural sights. It is one of the three Durbar Squares (including Kathmandu & Baktapur) in the Kathmandu Valleys which is the UNESCO World Heritage Site that is under the threat of earthquake especially the most destructive volcanic eruption in 2015. Restoration effort is ongoing to preserve these valuable historical and cultural site."

A traditional Newari city patan has a unique traditions as well as identity. As we were with my tour guide we were lucky to know most of the things that patan durbar square has. The Main durbar square is so unique with its wooden architecture as you see there so much wood work everywhere. The main house used to be the living place of the Malla Kings family in the past and there are many courtyard and Chowk inside. All of this Chowk has it’s own significance. Siddhi Narsingh Malla was the king who built many temples and part of durbar in 17th Century B.C. Krishna Temple was the another attraction over that squre which is built by the stone only in sikhara style which took 25 years to build by King Siddhi Narsingh Malla. The place also popular for buddhisim as there are a lot of sakya family and it has a lot of Boudha Bihar. Hiranya Barna Mahavihar is one of the popular. Overall our experience to patan was great with my guide Sabin as I learned many things. I tried the Newari food which was awesome but quite spicy. You must visit patan if you are coming to Nepal. Highly Recommended.

Basically I wanted to explore and run some rivers on my Kayak. But during my visit there, I was told to visit this place by a friend. Just how wonderful Patan Durbar square is for a traveller to experience some of the tradition & heritage structures of Nepal. the oldest of the three cities in the Kathmandu valley. The square is made up of 136 courtyards and 55 temples. It was destroyed by earthquake few years back and some places are still under maintenance & rebuilding stage. However all the structures are amazing, heritage Hindu kingdom. There are a number of historic temples & they include some extraordinary erotic carvings on one of the temples in a traditional South Asian style. The Patan Museum is also simply amazing. Also the Mahabuddha temple is an easy walk from here. You might get lucky to witness some religious processions and performances in the square as well. Supposedly these are fairly regular. So if you want to time your visit accordingly may be you can contact the tourist office before visiting. As I was alone and also less crowd during the morning visit, I got absorbed and felt so spiritual. There is so much ancient culture in this thriving and beautiful place.  This is a must visit place for all travellers to Nepal. I ticked off another beautiful destination on my unknown places bucket list :)  I bow down to this land and the people of this land who have built & preserved this gem of a place for the world to experience."

Most of the buildings are still under reconstruction but you can still admire the beauty of the Newari architecture.  We practically spent the whole day from mid morning until around six pm walking around the square and the side alleys of Lalitpur.  Try to avoid the evening as it is chaotic with all the cars, motorbikes and people walking around unless that is what you’re looking for.  The ticket gives you access to the museum which is a great way to learn about Buddhism and Hinduism through the sculptures, there is also a cafe inside. This was once part of the royal palace.  Avoid the museum shop which is extremely expensive and costs more than three times the prices of the shops around the town.  The square itself is very impressive with beautiful ancient buildings, a lot of buildings are still inaccessible due to the post earthquake reconstruction but the photo opportunities are constant.  The Newari architecture is phenomenal and the intricacy and detail of the arts and crafts is definitely something that is lacking within first world countries. The buildings in the adjacent streets and squares are stunning.  With incredible Stupas and shrines popping up in every corner and back street between houses and shops that have been there for centuries with most intact.  We encountered numerous Newari women working incessantly in the rebuilding of the area, carrying very heavy brick bags over their heads.  The streets are perfect for a shopping day with very impressive wood, metal and clay works available along with Mandala and Thaka art. Costing upwards of 1500 rupees for a student painting.  Barter for prices and compare one shop to another as some are double the price of others.  The roads are a bit crazy with motorcycles and cars passing all the time in tiny streets. But we felt very safe walking around and no one bothered us at all.  All in all an excellent walking adventure around Lalitpur and Patan Durbar Square."

She asked if we accept hands-on help, which I do because I appreciate. But as she asked us to do Urdhva-dhanurasana (wheel pose), she came to me telling me I wasn't doing it properly. She pushed me into going further into it until it became way to much for me, without giving me any support or hands-on help. She also made negative comment on my posture instead of helping me and making me feel safe. I have now been suffering from a bad kidney pain for two weeks, which my acupuncture doctor says is really bad and comparable to a punch in the kidneys. I strongly advise beginners not to go to Annie's class, which can be dangerous to people who don't have years of practice of Vinyasa.

I started my Yoga experience with Pranamaya and I've continued practising it now for one and a half years with them - somehow got addicted.  The studio is located in Moksh complex in Lalitpur, very conveniently in between all the restaurants and coffee shops that make Patan so attractive. The studio is very clean and professionally managed. Most techers and students are westerners, which is a little drawback. If you want to get in touch with the Expat community in Nepal - that's probably the best starting point.  They offer drop-in classes by many different teachers which makes it very easy to try out the different styles of yoga. It's no problem for people without experience to join the classes, just come and grab a mat - that's finally what made me tryout yoga. Uncomplicated!"

The quiet, hustle-free setting, lovely garden and trees just besides the eating tables, are a fresh change from most places in town. Have always enjoyed their food and cocktails, which, for a change, are quite better in terms of mixture and preparation, in comparison to most other bars in town. I've tried almost all their dishes, and I do appreciate the effort the kitchen and restaurant staff make.

As a chef and a person with a knowledge of the food industry I can honestly say that this was one of the worst dining experiences of my life.  I'll try be brief as I know how essay reviews are to read but seriously what I endured deserve one.  Yer well lovely looking place, nice sounding menu on the mid price range with some really tasty sounding options. Great. Lovely courtyard, perfect.  So my partner ordered the lasagna and I the Chinese inspired mushroom and pak choy. We had a great feeling as a place with great reviews and such a well presented location deserves high expectations. The lasagna came out only slightly warm and the middle still cold and as you can see from the photo not a lot of love to gratinate the cheese on top, a basic for any lasagna. We asked for it to me warmed and knowing a microwave would be the answer and sure enough after 2mins we received it warm of course but as expected the microwaved cheese leaking oil!!! Tasty!  My dish was actually very tasty exept for the 3rd bite including a rock. Okay, this for me is seriously unexectable, it is in no way a mistake, it tell me that the kitchen doesn't wash their pak choy!! This can pass for a street food dish but not a restaurant of this standard.  I called the waiter over, he took the dish away and then brought me the menu.... I of course asked for the manager. To be honest she handled the situation fairly well, after I suggested her to offer me a new complementary dish. The BLT that I ordered was tasty but really nothing special. Besides the fact that after the first bite she came running over to ask if ""I loved the new dish."" Seeing the waiters and the manager in the reflection standing around the cash register and looking over in my direction and laughing didn't help the already broken trust.  Wouldn't return and if I were you don't bother. Stick to a street side samosa."

I ordered a lasagna (i felt like a change from dhal bhat!) and it came cold... I asked them to warm it and obviously they didn't use an oven because the cheese was chewy, not crispy at all. I thought it was kind of my fault for ordering a ladagna in Kathmandu... But damn, for those prices they could put a little love and finish the job, because the flavour wasn't bad! The service was good though. I think the kitchen should raise the standards."

Wifi and newspapers available. Pleasant staff, pretty quick service. Extensive menu. Opted for a sandwich and cappuccino after 5 weeks of trekking type food- very good! Almost the best coffee to date for this trip- I'd go back for that alone. Chocolate cake was watery- ? Frozen/defrosted but still hit the spot. Free filtered water. Dinner was fine- different atmosphere. It had been raining and was quite cool so we sat inside- not as nice as the day time experience. Can recommend the spaghetti with pesto. Apparently outside toilets very clean, can't say the same for the inside one- dirty, with Mosquitos buzzing around. I had difficulty rating this cafe for my review- for day time cake and coffee i'd say very good, but for a dinner experience - Average."

It is an open air café in a garden setting. A point to note before ordering is that tea/coffee/ cocoa orders are provided in pots, not cups - a pot fills nearly 3 cups. Fairly pricey place which I guess is partly to do with its location in the museum complex. After a great experience at the Patan Museum, the Cafe was a letdown, apart from the garden setting."

When we went there, there were only a couple of us so I loved that it seemed so peaceful and quiet compared to the noise at the Durbar Square. The cafe is inside the Royal Palace and it is very interesting to find a modern garden setting in the middle of everything that's of Newari architecture.  The cafe is operated by the Summit Hotel so the service is expectedly very ""hotelish"" -- white napkins, well-dressed waiters, etc. It's not a complaint though but I've always liked to dine in places where it's more local and authentic. Nevertheless, the cafe is a very welcome break from all the walking around temples and red-brick houses. I loved that it was quiet and peaceful and of course, service was very prompt and very attentive.  There was very good food presentation, expectedly again! But I wouldn't say it's extraordinary. But it's not bad. :) We ordered Nepali food so just by that alone is already a big thing for us. Naturally, it's a bit pricey compared to the other ones. But if you're looking for a relaxing lunch hour, then maybe you should choose this one."

You are not supposed to wear leather shoes inside the premises. That is not a strange practice because in Sri Lanka you are not supposed to wear any type of footwear into a temple as a mark of respect.  You will hear Tibetan Buddhist chantings when you are in the Golden temple and if you feel the need to buy one, do not hesitate as you will never regret buying the music which has the ability of calming your stressed out nerves!

Staff’s are very generous respectful and polite. One of the best services we have seen so far. They were trying to accommodate all our requests and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. We were delighted to have the opportunity to choose different locations for our morning breakfast. Fascinating. We were very impressed and delighted with our initial two night stay; therefore we booked another 7 nights. Overall experience was excellent. Kudos to Timila management and staff.

The menu is really impressive and looks more like a picture book for a coffee table. I really think it is the nicest menu I have ever seen and it explains the dishes. This is unique and so is the food.  We chose the platters which you can try a variety of the dishes (I do recommend this). Although one of the soups (?) was really terrible but only because it didn't suit our taste buds…it reminded me of sewage unfortunately and was a concoction of several types of beans. Otherwise, the other dishes I thought were impressing and many flavours I have never tried before.  The service didn't get any better and unfortunately I didn't bring mosquito spray and scored many bites, so we had to go inside to ask for the bill which took about 15 minutes more to produce the small piece of paper. Organisation is not there strong point, however if you overlook this, the food & atmosphere are at least worth coming for at least once."

We walked by it several times and finally made the inclination to try it. The staff started out very accommodating and helpful and were always friendly but the service really deteriorated as time went on. The menu is impressive and comprehensive, but I noted the wine list to be very expensive for some of the wines that I knew about, but a decent list all the same. I was very excited to see 'mole poblano', a speciality Mexican dish on the menu. We ordered this and a salad as we were not that hungry. As we waited, the ambience was nice and relaxing. When the food came, it was disappointing to see the size of the salad and the mole, especially given the price. The salad was average and for the price you would have expected something creative at least as a garnish. The mole poblano: firstly look up this dish on Google Images and then go to this restaurant and order it. You will be completely shocked. Not only in terms of presentation but taste and texture as well (if you know mole). It was not remotely similar in any way. It was basically a Nepalese curry with small chunks of poorly cut chicken pieces (with cartilage & some bone fragments). The spices they used were nothing to do with the Mexican equivalent. AFter we received the meal, the waiter no longer came to our table (in which we may have ordered more drinks). He came when we were long finished and asked how it was. I politely told him to share with the chef to take the dish of the menu of for the reasons politely explained above. He made no effort to offer any apology, replacement or take it off the bill. This might also portray then management at Vesper. Ok that is fine. It is just disappointing. I will say the pizza's looked great and asked the table next to us what they thought of them. They said the pizza was good but the minestrone soup they both had was 'very interesting' with a mutual chuckle after overhearing my conversation with the waiter. I still think it is a nice place to visit for a nice evening out with friends but avoid the Mexican menu as they have no clue what they are making, and don't expect high standards of food quality as it does not match the atmosphere. I agree with the review of 21 May below…more realistic with my experience at Vesper."

This place showcases Bohra cuisine with recipes passed down through generations. The complexity of flavors and the richness of the dishes showed the TLC put into the cooking. We focused on the kebabs accompanied by Gorkha beer. I have rarely tasted such tender meat. The mutton sigri and chicken cutlet melt in the mouth. The butter chicken is amazing as the gravy is the best that I have tasted. I had the Nihari which was also excellent but the biryani was already finished ( to my deep regret). The restaurant is in an old Nepali house and is spread over three levels. The place was full of groups of friends and family with a really fun vibe.

The food tasted amazing, so much flavour and just the right amount of spice - really very good. We had a mixture of meat and veggie dishes; the butter chicken is one of the nicest curries I’ve ever tasted (the chicken is shredded rather than being in “lumps” so the meat is really soft) and the dahl was great too. The mutton dish wasn’t to my taste, but the meat was very soft with a thick rich sauce.  The actual restaurant is very nice too, the beautiful entrance, the terrace and the low tables on the second floor where you sit on chairs resting on the floor. It’s also interesting to read about the culture of the owner and some of the their traditions around food and eating together as a family.  A great evening, will definitely go back if I’m in Kathmandu again!"

Furnished with simple decor with seating available indoors and outdoors in an internal courtyard, TKK is a restaurant with no-frills and only authentic finger licking good food.  What makes the entire dining experience at TKK different is how the leading lady Tasneem eloquently explains the whole meal and the significance behind it's origin. Not many restaurants provide you with such a homely service, where you are acknowledged about how the each dish in your meal is prepared.  We pre-ordered the famous Bohra Thaali to celebrate New Year's Eve at TKK. A Bohra meal is a big platter of authentic Bohra Cuisine. The whole meal begins by passing the salt and it is only after each member is seated around and has tasted it that the first course is served. All members from the family dines out of one platter called the thaal. The meal was accommodated for ten people.  Interestingly, the first course is dessert, which was a complete new way of dining for us.The Bohras consider it auspicious to begin their meal with a sweet dish. In the Bohra language, all desserts are called mithaas and the savoury dishes kharaas.  The main course featured lip-smacking Curries for vegetarians and unforgettable Chicken and Mutton dishes for the carnivores teamed with Flavored Rice and Naan Roti. But that’s not all, the meal ended with Gajar Ka Halwa and Paan which is a must for the eaters to cleanse their tongue.  Apart from this, past visits made our family a regular at TKK. The Biryani is legendary here: The meats, herbs and spices are placed in a pot that is then sealed and slow-cooked over a very low flame for hours. The meat cooks in its own juices, taking on the flavors of the seasoning, and resulting in a hearty and aromatic dish that is the specialty of TKK.  All in all, the food is excellent and the servings are very generous. Definitely, worth the value. If you haven't dined at TKK yet then tsk tsk tsk ;)"

It was also a reunion of sorts as when living in Kathmandu ten years ago, we were regulars of Tasneem’s home catering, food perfect for house parties – wholesome deliciousness with homey flavours. Tasneem had since then gone on to open her restaurant and my husband and I were keen to see the place and, of course, to meet Tasneem and her family – it had been exactly ten years since we saw them last. Twelve of us were booked for lunch at TKK and to be honest, we were wondering how the restaurant would manage, expecting a Mom and Pop operation. However, on reaching TKK, we were charmed by the lovely and well run restaurant created by Tasneem and her husband, Harshawardhan.  We were also delighted to find that the food served was as wholesome as we remembered from years ago but the flavours had been upped to pack a restaurant dining experience punch. Right from the aam panna and the jal jeera drinks that we ordered to the starters and the main meal to dessert – every thing was fabulous! As we were 12 of us with different preferences, we made our choices there and then, ordering off the menu, so it can be safely said that everyone else in the restaurant, too, was having the same quality of food that we were served.  Of special mention are the scrumptious Bohra Chicken Cutlets (nothing comes close to the ones served at TKK – even in Bombay which is known for this cutlet) with the mince succulent and a light coating of egg cooked just right; the innovative vegetarian seekh kabab delivering an intense burst of flavour; the fragrant mutton biryani and the equally aromatic vegetable biryani with the delectable pineapple raita; the delicious kababs and tandoor items – vegetarian and non vegetarian – perfectly grilled, lightly crusted on the outside, juicy on the inside.  Saving the best for last is Tasneem’s signature Butter Chicken prepared in a unique way. Instead of the usual chunky tikkas of chicken, you are served pulled chicken (marinated and cooked slowly till tender enough to be pulled into strips) in a rich, creamy gravy. The resultant dish is a luscious blend with the gravy going deep into every bit of chicken unlike the usual dish made with chunks of meat with the gravy only coating the tikka. The Butter Chicken made in Tasneem’s style is also easy to have with the pulled chicken lending itself to being wrapped and eaten in any roti of your choice unlike the tikka style as larger chunks do not hold well in rotis like the thicker tandoori and paratha. While on rotis, there is an assortment of Indian breads, the garlic butter naan being a personal favourite, as is the velvety phirni we ordered for dessert.  It is easy to see that Tasneem has not compromised in any way on the high standards she set for herself when starting out and catering to smaller groups of people with her wholesome and appetizing home catering. For instance, her mutton kababs still have no tallow added, something many commercial establishments resort to, to increase volume and quantity. The change: from catering from her home, her setting is now TKK – a warm and inviting place – where she and her husband make you feel at home, providing exceptional Indian food with the young and enthusiastic wait staff providing excellent service. Tasneem’s home catering set a benchmark in Kathmandu. Her restaurant sets it once again. Will be back for the Nihari and Kabsa. Good luck and best wishes."

It has now been more than two years since I wrote my first review, and this is still without any doubt in my mind the best Indian restaurant in Kathmandu. They serve Bohri cuisine, which is much more flavorful than the typical chicken tikka masala and dry tandoori chicken I was used to. I cannot eat biryani anywhere else (in Kathmandu or back home in the U.S.), because Tasneem has spoiled me with the best!  I'm writing now because last night was an exceptional experience, even for Tasneem's. I was part of a large private group that rented out the whole restaurant. Most restaurants I know aren't capable of serving 50 people at once without running into delays in service and over- or undercooked dishes. We were an especially complicated (and demanding) group—a mix of thulo manche, professors, university students, and local project staff. Yet somehow in all of the chaos we created, Tasneem served us a magnificent, unforgettable feast that everyone was raving about the rest of the night.  We enjoyed Tasneem's signature kabsa as well as a very wide array of other dishes—veg, vegan, and meat. (Plus the best gazar ko halwa I've ever tasted.) Even the daal was amazing—no joke. The service and food were flawless, which let our group enjoy good spirits and great conversation all night long. I would definitely take a group here again. And again... and again. ;)"

Well appointed solar panels that do not jar the sights also contribute towards the power requirements of the restaurant. All of this is discretely set in a very natural environment. A place where you would like to relax and enjoy your food.  Then to the food itself. Had 6 starters cannot decide which one should get a special mention. All had it's unique flavours and authenticity, a welcome change from restaurants that have a common base for all foods. Most of the starters had the ""Bohra"" touch. For those not in the know the ""Bohra's"" are a small community in India that is know for it's unique dishes that tickle every palate and want in you. The serving that night certainly stirred my want to come back to the restaurant again and I was still on my starters.

What's more the food comes with same personal one on one hospitality that makes the experience even more enjoyable. You may taste the spices and the different flavours, but according to me they serve their heart on the plate.  The butter chicken is delectable and so tender and spiced so perfect it is like perfect balance of mother's love and traditional cooking skills. The biryanis are perfection in traditional dum pukht cooking.  I would definitely recommend a visit once, from then on you will make it on your own once a week at least, can bet you on that."

Superb taste sensations and authentic Indian (Muslim Bohra) food.  All the items were equally good. In fact, it was challenging to rate one item better than the other. I specially recommend the Biryani. I always believed that the Dum Biryani in Hyderabad (the signature dish) was the best biryani ever, but after having Biryani at Tasneems' I can very comfortably endorse this as the Best Biryani EVER.  I would strongly recommend everyone to try it once and you will know what I mean.  I will definitely come back here whenever I come to Nepal again.

The restaurant offers both outdoor and indoor seating. The ambience is subtle with modest cots placed at the entrance and simple yet comfortable furniture to seat you. The decor is minimalistic, creative and tastefully done to present a unique dining experience. Rainwater harvesting at the restaurant speaks volumes about the owner's commitment to offer a sustainable culinary experience to it's customers. We have been to the restaurant twice and have already become great admirers of the food that they serve here. The chicken butter masala is a speciality of TKK and it's delicious. You have to try it to experience a whole new taste for this otherwise run of the mill dish. You can request for the dishes to be made spicy or not so spicy as preferred by you. We had also ordered for some chicken biryani and the chicken in the biryani literally melted in our mouths. I have never had chicken that soft ever in my life. My dad does not normally like eating outdoors. Even he ended up having more than his normal share of the food! The most important part of any dining experience for us is the hospitality. The TKK staff does a fine job here. Beginning with getting your hands washed using the bowl and pitcher, already makes you feel special. This is an experience you probably wouldn't find at many restaurants. Dishes are served with a smile and the owner, Tasneem can often be seen interacting with the guests at the restaurant. This restaurant has several items to offer and we have only explored a few. There's a lot more still remaining to have us visiting the place several times over!"

I host a monthly dinner club in Kathmandu, and we went to Tasneem's for our most recent gathering. From the minute I created the event to when we were walking out of the door at the end of the evening, Tasneem and her staff were kind, accommodating, and professional. We had over 25 people come for the dinner club and Tasneem arranged two different spaces in her restaurant to accommodate our large group--one outside in the beautiful garden space, and another in the upstairs level of the restaurant in the case of rain. When I arrived at her restaurant, she promptly greeted me and gave me a tour of the space, and was present throughout the evening to make food recommendations and ensure that everyone was happy. And that doesn't even begin to describe the food, which is the best Indian food I have ever eaten. Tasneem has been in the food industry for over 10 years, and her experience shows. I only have a few weeks left in Kathmandu, but I am going to make returning to Tasneem's one of my priorities. It's affordable and simply delicious.

The food we ordered was fantastic, but the Butter Chicken was divine. If you go, try their signature dish, but based on our experience, you cant go wrong no matter what you order. I get the impression that our dishes were not as spicy as they normally make them as we had two small children with us and we asked them to keep it spiced for the kids. My husband had gone with a friend on a different occasion and he said that the food was much spicier (and delicious!).  But the food was only the half of it. The owner is so kind and engaging. Made us feel so welcome. Our waiter made recommendations on how much to order (perfect amount!), the food came out fast but without making us feel hurried. The best part was that we had brought our 16 month old and 3 year old with us, and the staff helped us entertain them so we could enjoy our meal.

One of the nicest things about that night was how courteous the staff was. They catered to every one of my elderly grandmother's needs. Even the owner came to talk to us about the food. That is definitely a good sign of a good owner!  One last little thing that I wish were different is the serving portions. If they were a little bigger, I would love it.

We were told to go here, so we made the walk. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and promptly sat outside in the patio area. The decorations and aura gave this place an authentic feel for an Indian restaurant.  We got our menus and started thinking about our order, when a lady (who turned out to be Tasneem herself) came by to help us decide what to order. I am an American who cannot normally handle a lot of heat from the spices, but I was traveling with two guys who love spicy food. She encouraged us to get a couple appetizers as well as some different dishes.  My absolute favorites were the Mutton Appetizer and the House Special Butter Chicken. The Mutton is pounded flat, then spiced and fried. It is still moist, but crispy. The flavour seems to just be jam-packed in this bite. Then came the Butter Chicken. I haven't had a dish that tasted this delicious in a while. The food textures of meat and gravy melt together leaving this savory experience. Pair this with their garlic butten naan, and you have a winner.  They had some happy hour specials on local beers and cocktails. The mocktails are made with fresh juices.  We then met Tasneem's husband. They were very kind and gave us recommendations for things to do in Kathmandu and surrounding areas. I strongly recommend going to see Tasneem if you visit. You will not be disappointed. We liked it so much, we came back for a second meal in 4 days there.  The second time, we ended up ordering pretty much the same; we just knew what to expect. We were able to add a little heat to the dishes this time, and it was still amazing for all of us.  It is nice in the patio area, with the cool breezes and the ambiance. There is no wifi as they encourage you to talk with your table, but this does not mean that they are not engaged with their customers. The owners take pride in the ability to listen to customers and their experiences.  Do yourself a favour and check this place out."

Very attentive and pleasant service, perhaps because the eponymous Tasneem is in constant attendance, with friendly greetings and goodbyes to customers. Food is good but far from startling. I had a competently cooked Dahl and some paneer but it didn’t sing with flavour as the food does in the better Indian restaurants. Maybe it needed waking up with some fresh herbs or something? I left feeling happy with the evening, but wondering if there’s been overinvestment in the lovely building and too little investment in the food. Time for a recipe review?"

I've been to most every top restaurant in Kathmadu Valley over these last 2 years here on business, and as a former restaurant owner and exec, I am critical on both quality of food and service.  I've gotten hooked on Tasneem's biryanis and curries. The chicken is moist and succulent. Nothing is over-spiced or over salted here...(as most restaurants are infamous for as a way to mask the lower quality of meats and lack of experience needed to execute a dish properly). At Tasneem's you will find skilled chefs generationally trained in proper authentic techniques, and all using from what I've come to know, very fresh and quality ingredients.  The kitchen is more than clean. See for yourself! And the staff is warm and friendly. I see a long bright success for Tasneem's King's Kitchen, and I'll tell you the main reason...it's ownership. It's a husband and wife duo, a sincere family effort, and they can be found there most any night. And in my professional experience, that can't be beat.  This is what a family fine dining experience should be :)  Long Live Tasneem's King's Kitchen!!!  Respectfully, David Lubov Henderson"

There are indoor seatings, but because the winter in Kathmandu valley is mostly mild and sunny I decided to sit outside and bask in the pleasant morning sun that hits the outdoor seating area.  It's a really pretty place in a quieter side of Jamsikhel. The meticulously arranged seatings and the overall decor of the cafe is very inviting. The tables and the decoration that sits of those tables are clean, and so are the chairs, the floor, the utensils (you got the point!).  I think the staff have a hard time striking the balance between being professional and laidback.  Here's my experience: On my first visit when I made it to the second floor I saw a lady perching out of the balcony. I went inside the cafe and having seen no one came right back out. Then, I asked the lady whom I had seen earlier if she worked there. She smiled and replied affirmatively.  So I told her that it was my first time there and she immediately pointed towards the menu board. She did not recommend anything. No worries, I thought to myself. Right before I ordered another staff member had entered and so the two had started to engage in a lengthy conversation.  So, finally after catching the lady's attention I ordered a cup of drip coffee ( which was ok) and asked her how and where I should pay. She said pay here and I could sit anywhere I would like (inside or outside). Then, they started engaging in, I am guessing, an important conversation.  The trinkets that were on display caught my attention and started looking at them. I was really impressed by what they had on display so I hurriedly asked the servers (now there were two of them) if they were on sale and exclaimed how beautiful they were in Nepalese.  [So, here is the thing I haven't lived in Nepal for 20 (I'm 28, almost) years, so having lived in the West for so long my Nepalese accent is a bit blah.]  Immediately after I asked them those questions, a burst of laughter cracked. Now I am not sure if that was directed towards me or they were laughing at whatever they were talking to each other about. I felt embarrassed, nonetheless.  After a minute or so, the other lady jumped and told me that they were all on sale. I thanked her for her response. Then I asked the lady who took my order if I can pay (again). Now she was sitting down and replied that I could. At this point I was a bit annoyed because of what had transpired and I wasn't particularly sure where to pay, so I looked at her straight and said ""so can I pay now."" Anyway, I don't think she got my point. I paid and got myself a table. That same lady brought the coffee to my table. I thanked her. I sent out an email (they have free wi-fi, yippie!) and left.  In retrospect, I really think this was all a big misunderstanding, and I sure hope that they were not laughing at me.  I am saying that this was all a big misunderstanding because don't think anyone can be that rude, especially not Nepalese people. But, I don't see how I can go back to this otherwise nice place."

It is run by an Austrian lady and she keeps on adding new products to her portofolio constantly. The place is coffee-shop and showroom at the same time, where you can not only drink coffee but also shop for locally produced, recycled or imported products related to coffee. Lucky for me, they have added tea to their menue some time ago, which is also grown in Nepal - like the coffee - and of outstanding quality.  The ""kar.ma"" in the name probably refers to the pricing system for the coffee specialities - there is no menue - you just pay what you think it's worth. Because of that it's not one of the many overpriced restaurants in the area where you usually only meet foreigners or rich Nepalis, but just about everyone that likes to have a coffee or tea once in a while. The coffee-shop has quickly developed into a meeting place for many ex-pats living in the area and people working in nearby offices. Many customers are also coming from the ""Pranamaya Yoga Studio"" below the place or the ""Kathmandu Jazz Conservatory"" right above. Interesting conversations and new friendships are nearly inevitable which makes it a perfect starting point if you are new to the area. If there is no one around to talk to, you can always use the free Wifi to surf the net until somebody interesting shows up. Be careful as this place is somehow addictive. For me and some of my friends it has become something like an external living room!  They don't have a food menue as such but sell various home-made organic cookies. As they cooperate with nearby restaurants, you can ask them to order sandwiches or other simple foods which are then delivered to the coffee-shop."

As well as the chicken was much smaller than the hard crusty battered shell it was in. For dessert we had the sizzling brownie. The flavor of the brownie was excellent however as it was served sizzling, it was continually cooking and ended up a bit burnt on the bottom. The staff were excellent and very attentive to our table and cleared the dishes off the tables as soon as they were emptied. All in all it was a good experience and the food was not bad.

I arrived on a Sunday evening (I was staying at the Piano B&B above the restaurant). I walked in and instantly knew this was somewhere I could trust. I told the owner, Antonio that I was too tired to think and to just choose what he thought I should eat. There are very few restaurants I would be happy to have choose the food for me, Piano B is one of them. The food is absolutely delicious! I mean every single thing they make is delicious, from the fresh bread, olive oil and balsamic to nibble on while you order, to the cheese and meat plater to the perfectly al dente pasta dishes to the high quality wine they store.  Antonio has established an amazing little restaurant and to anyone in Kathmandu who has heard of Piano B but never visited, you really need to go there. This guy is working his butt off to deliver quality and having spent 7 weeks in Kathmandu this summer, I have seen the time and effort he is putting into his place.  Having stayed at the B&B above I had the pleasure of eating many many times at this restaurant, its hard to find food this good in my current city of Boston, never mind Kathmandu. And if you're reading this thinking, ""Italian food? In Nepal? Why?"" then you've the same thought my colleagues had when they travelled to Nepal for 4 days last week towards the end of my trip. After I took them there, one commented in the morning that he dreamt of the Spinach Ravioli and despite the two thinking I was crazy to take them to an Italian on their four day visit to Nepal, they insisted we go back the very next night, and were again served with the same amazing food.  Like the B&B the restaurant is well managed, the staff are polite and professional, the ambience is tasteful as is the music. They stock real beer, real wine, real COFFEE, and trust me all of it meets the highest of standards of a classy Italian restaurant. I would say this is the best restaurant in all of Kathmandu and probably Nepal, yes its not traditional Nepali food, but quality is quality!  So just go there! And get the little onion dish starter thing. Oh and the chocolate lava cake. And an espresso to finish. And drink their house white.  I'm coming back!"

We spend good time even though It's painful to see the animals in cage ,but it's the only chance to see animals are housed within enclosures, cared for, displayed to the public, and in some cases bred Modern zoos also aim to help teach visitors the importance on animal conservation, often through letting visitors witness the animals firsthand. Some critics and the majority of animal rights activists say that zoos, no matter what their intentions are, or how noble they are, are immoral and serve as nothing but to fulfill human leisure at the expense of the animals (which is an opinion that has spread over the years). However, zoo advocates argue that their efforts make a difference in wildlife conservation and education. Many zoos work to improve their animal enclosures and make it fit the animals' needs, although constraints such as size and expense make it difficult to create ideal captive environments for many species. Animals in zoos often exhibit behaviors that are abnormal in their frequency, intensity, or would not normally be part of their behavioural repertoire. These are usually indicative of stress. For example, elephants sometimes perform head-bobbing, bears sometimes pace repeatedly around the limits of their enclosure, wild cats sometimes groom themselves obsessively, and birds pluck out their own feathers. Some critics of zoos claim that the animals are always under physical and mental stress, regardless of the quality of care towards the animals."

This zoo was establish more than 100yr old is by Rana primeminister. At that time it was one of the best and lovely place to visit for the animals of Nepal. In the courses of time it could not be modified only very little changes are done to accommodate more animals. Instead of more animals in the zoo we found less animals but more people due to the growth of population and there is no place for children to take. People come here to see people instead animals. Unfortunately one of the beautiful historic zoo of Kathamandu turned ugly zoo.

Especially the beautiful birds were worth the entrance fee though, and the walk around the premises is nice. All in all I have mixed feelings about this place. It's definitely not a must-see, but if you have a day to spare in Lalitpur and nothing to do, it's a nice place to take younger kids. They have pedal-boats in a pond in the centre of the park and a teeny-tiny fun park."

The Patan Durbar Square has many distinctive and interesting temples and structures: Krishna Temple, Royal Palace Patan, Jagannarayan Temple, Keshav Narayan Temple, Char Naarayan Temple, Golden Temple and others. When we had visited Patan Durbar Square on November 2019, we found most all of the structures here had been either not affected by the 2015 earthquake or were repaired quickly - we saw only a couple of structures that were being ""repaired"". This is in contrast to the Kathmandu Durbar Square which had multiple structures that are still in need of earthquake damage repair when we had visited that location. In summary, the Patan Durbar Square is in excellent shape - almost all the structures show no earthquake damage and the whole area is visually quite stunning as you enter the Square. The Ancient Nepal architecture here at the Square looks very impressive and makes for good photography. Highly recommend seeing the Patan Durbar Square, and if you have time walk down through some of the side streets to see the residential areas that surrounds the Square - interesting!"

They will show you where the entrance is and tell you how much you need to pay which incidentally was 1000 Nepalese Rupee each. They generally have a tour guide license. After I asked he said a tour would cost 1000 Nepalese Rupee each and a tip is expected. At least they are upfront about the costs so it’s always fair. One of the temples in Patan Durbar Square (the Golden Temple) had a cost of 100 Nepalese Rupee each, bringing the total cost to 3200 Nepalese Rupee for two people, excluding the tip. Our guide took us to a place where they showed us healing/singing bowls. They put the bowl on your head and strike it gently with what looks like a rubber mallet which creates a soothing massaging effect. They also put the bowl on your back and do much the same. They also put water in the bowl and roll the rubber mallet around the edge and the water jumps up like a fountain because of the vibration. “It’s magic!” I said to the vendor. “No, it’s just physics,” he responded.

Our guide spent a lot of time telling us about the reconstruction, and it appears that it is going well and will look as it did before the earthquake when finished. Almost every building is propped up with huge boards to stabilize them, and large cracks are seen everywhere.  There are still plenty of beautiful carvings to see on the buildings and carved stone figures and statues throughout. We went to visit the house of the Kumari Devi (the Living Goddess). We could not go in but were allowed in the courtyard to see if she would make an appearance at a window. No photos allowed if she appeared. She did appear and looked out at everyone. This goddess is a 5 year old girl who lives apart from her family until she reaches puberty. It was quite an interesting story.  Worth a visit even though some people complained about the entrance fee. The entrance fee is worth it if this trip is something that you will probably never do again, so why not?"

I didn't enter Kathmandu Durbar Square cause of the expensive entrance fee but it seemed in complete disarray and didn't think there would be much to see.  The Patan Durbar Square also has a lot of rehabilitation going on but it's not as tight and stressful to get into as the Kathmandu one.

A huge plus about going to Patan Durbar Square is that it houses the Patan Museum, which is easily the best museum I've been to in Nepal. It was very informative and described facts about Hindi and Buddhist history, iconography, symbolisms, and belief systems. I really appreciated that. Because of this, you wouldn't need a tour guide anymore.  Some groups got a tour guide and they sometimes spoke loudly to be heard. Because of that, I would get some interesting new information at random and that was a nice little surprise.  I highly recommend going to this place!"

International tourists are ticketed at R1000 entry, which in part goes towards the extensive rebuilding required as large parts of the square are currently being rebuilt. Expect lots of bracing of the temples and areas under significant reconstruction, supported largely by foreign aid. There is extensive earthquake damage to masonry and timber features, and yet still makes for a fascinating visit. Expect to get pretty harangued by hawkers in the area, they are polite and will generally leave you alone after the first “no” but it does detract from observing what is clearly still a functioning religious site. There are guides that hang around the entry that can walk you round but it’s probably easier to forego that and just experience the area."

We had a local guide that was organized for us through Global Holidays (also, highly recommended) and he was very helpful in guiding us through the square and telling us the stories and history of the place.  The old palace is amazing, and has been turned into a very informative museum. The detail in the wood carving is ridiculous! It must have taken many hours of work to do all of the fine etching that is evident. The details are incredible. The Newari architecture is very interesting and picturesque.  The area was hit by the earthquake and is still evident, but much of the restoration has already been started, The 1000 Ru entry fee is well worth it, especially if part of the money helps the locals restore the site (which is all being done by hand). Definitely worth seeing."

Interesting mix of Hinduism and Buddhism ,it has 136 courtyards and 55 temples of various Gods of Hinduism and incarnates of Buddhism . The Krishna temple is most important one in this complex . Built in 16th century by the Malla king ,it has three stories and temple of Radha Krishna on 1st floor , Siva on the second and Buddha on the third . Unfortunately , in the 2015 earthquake ,it was badly damaged , and is being renovated now . Bhimsen temple was built by Srinivasa Malla in 1680. It is renowned for its three interconnected golden windows. Bhimsen is a great hero in Mahabharata. He was known to be very brave and strong. In Newa tradition, he is worshipped as a god of business and trade. (Wikipedia) The three main courtyards in the palace are Mul Chok, Sundari Chok and Keshav Narayan Chok. Besides these courtyards, the complex boasts impressive temples, religious shrines, and historical places, all noted for their exquisite carvings and beautiful display of ancient Newari architecture (Wikipedia) Hiraṇyavarṇa Mahāvihāra (Nepali: हिरण्यवर्ण महाविहार), also Kwa Bahal (Nepali: क्वबहा:) informally called The Golden Temple with literal meaning ""Gold-colored Great Monastery"" is a historical vihara (Buddhist monastery) situated in Patan, Nepal.

We spend almost 4 hours wandering around the area to appreciate the beauty of it until we accidentally witness a religious ceremony that perform by locals inside the temple: they behead a baby buffalo( sacrificing to some Gods). Unprepared for what was going on back then,we were in shock and the image of them pulling the next buffalo up to be beheaded(while the poor buffalo clearly shivering and hesitated to walk ahead) more or less kill the mood for the rest of the day. We were out of that temple right after seconds comprehending what was going on,very upset.  We respect the local culture and religious belief but just for the experience: if you don't want to see unexpected slaughter,as soon as you see animals (buffaloes , goats,etc at their unusual residence) +some kind of rituals going on+a crowd around it,don't look and walk away,we are sure there are lot of other ways to experience Nepal than witnessing some animals slaughtered."

Let's be honest here. Patan's Durbar Square is a shadow of its former grandeur, and every structure is largely hidden under extensive scaffolding. The Museum (which is part of your 1,000rp ticket) only had 1/8th of its exhibition space open for public use, with the rest being refurbished/repaired.  My partner and I are empathetic with the earthquake repair process, and are happy considering our payment there as a donation. However, it is disingenuous (and honestly somewhat manipulative) to pretend otherwise.  The very high price of entry is a donation towards mending the damage of the earthquake, and should not be taken as indicative of the quality of the experience in Patan's Durbar Square.  Left feeling quite deflated and disappointed."

Am taking half day tours to various cities and venues. Today I visited Durbar Square in Patan, not far from Kathmandu. My guide asked me ""Do you want to see a living goddess?"" I replied "" You mean The Kumari?"" He said ""You know The Kumari"" and I explained that I studied the Nepali tradition of worshipping living goddesses. We went to the home she lives in with her family. My guide said to wait as he would see if she was sleeping. She saw me. What a thrill! The living goddess is seven years old and two years into her ""reign"" and she appeared to be stoic, fearless, and very very special. She gave me a blessing and I asked for blessings for some docent friends who would appreciate the gesture. The Kumari then rubbed a red paste pigment on my forehead. I placed a small donation on her large tray near her throne. I have great respect for cultural traditions that do not harm people. Durbar Square is worth seeing. Many cities in Nepal have a square called Durbar Square in which a former palace was built. Most of the palaces in this region were damaged in,and restored after, the earthquake of 2015. Many countries and charities donated to the efforts and it is remarkable how quickly buildings were restored. Stroll through the side paths of the square, get ""lost"" alone or with a guide, see chickens, people working, people making food, embroidering cloths, eat at a local place to taste their cuisine, TALK to the people, at least try. Students like to practice their English with tourists. Yes, as others have noted, pay the 1000 or 1500 rupees entrance fee to these UNESCO sites and take it all in. They are worth every rupee!"

The is the perfect time to visit Kathmandu and the nearby, world heritage site of the old city centre of Patan's, Durbar Square. A trip there is now especially gratifying, as the local economy is heavily dependent on tourism, which has significantly fallen from pre-earthquake days. From Kathmandu, it is an easy, thirty minute taxi ride to this living museum. While there is evidence of earthquake damage, most of the splendid buildings remain intact. There is a palpable vibrancy and optimism that adds to the energy of the place. Walking amidst the magnificently carved ancient wooden temples is a powerful experience. The very impressive Patan Museum in the historic town centre is not be missed. (And the delicious veggie momos in the museum's terrace café make for a splendid break!)"

The super interesting Patan Museum and its nice (and a little expensive) garden café was open (apart from a few, destroyed parts of the building everything was accessible) and the square is less busy than its two counterparts in the valley. It is a great place to hang out, stroll around and witness everyday life in Nepal. Across the street, above the market stalls and up a narrow staircase, there is an amazing café/restaurant (sadly, I don't remember the name) with the most beautiful woodcarved windows, through which you can watch the square and its inhabitants while enjoying a plate of momos and a cup of sweet chia.

His own house was destroyed but he said that he was blessed as no one from his family was injured in any way. Houses will eventually be rebuilt.

I made the mistake of hiring a guide which for 1000 rupees wasn't worth it- he was nice and showed me where the golden temple was (just off the square) and getting in the museum (through the golden door). He told me about the buildings in the square and their significance and what had been lost in the earthquake (only 2 pagodas so not much) but in hindsight I didn't need to pay for someone to show me round. Tip- do pay 400 rupees to go in the museum through the golden door- it's worth every penny to learn about Hinduism and Buddhism and see lots of statues.

Though I didn't begrudge having to pay 500 NPR to gain entry as a foreigner per se, I was disappointed that by going around the back of the square you basically got the same experience for free. The other think I did not like was that a number of the Temples and monuments had locals sitting all over them. Like Thamel - foreigners are immediately targeted by sales people, beggars etc. I don't mean to sound crass but it does get annoying (the sales people).  In any event - it's neat, there are lots of shops in the nearby alleys and really 500 NPR is not expensive."

Bring some spending money for souvenirs as there are a number of vendors in the area with hand-made crafts. There's also a cultural museum that has a number of interesting displays. I'd suggest allocating 2-3 hours if you'd like to see all that this square has to offer and get a snack or meal in one of the surrounding restaurants.

I usually tend not to take local guides in touristy places like Patan Durbar Square. This time I agreed to have a guided tour and it was a wise decision. The Durbar Square itself, with plenty of different temples and shrines, can probably be visited by your own, but the rest of the city including Golden Temple, Mahabudha Temple or Rudra Varna Mahavihar is as interesting as the main square, but the temples are not so easy to be found as they are hidden in the courtyards and not visible from the streets. Also, the story of the monks in the Golden Temple or sacrifices at the main square are worth listening to. Great place!"

Before you start, open google maps and key in the following four locations to get the route overview which will help me to explain.  A) ""Ratna Park"" or ""Ratna Park Micro"" or ""Ratna Park Bus Stop, B) Koteshwor, Kathmandu, Nepal C) Lagankhel Bus Station, Lalitpur, Central Region, Nepal D) Patan Durbar Square, Lalitpur, Nepal  1. Walked from my Hotel Access Nepal in Thamel to Ratna Park(A), around 2 kms. 2. There just ask for which bus goes to Koteshwor(B). The bus I took continued from the Ring Road to the Arakino Highway instead of turning left towards (B). So keep that in mind and ensure you get down accordingly and cross the road to the point (B). 3. From (B), the few buses I asked were unable to understand Patan Durbar Square!! Instead ask for Lagankhle Bus Stop (C) and you will have several buses to take you there. 4. From (C), you have to walk to Patan Durbar. It's a interesting walk and you wont regret it.  Note ------- 1. You probably could check if a direct bus to Lagankhale is there from ""Ratna Park"". I was not aware of the name Lagankhel at that time. 2. Keep small changes handy as the buses are going to be crowded and cramped and you may not be able to dig deep in your pockets ! 3. Start early as possible to avoid the traffic and the crowd. 4. Sit as close to the door of the bus as possible."

Very interesting. it's a nice place to walk for a while...if you can sit in a stais or in a temple to see people going by is a nice sempsation, kids playing, Old people sitting in benchs each aafternoon to see life passing by....a really good choice!!!"

This Durbar Square is, however, in Patan which, at one time, would have been separate from old Kathmandu. Kathmandu has extended so much it has now swallowed areas that might have, historically, been townships in their own right.  Patan Durbar Square has more impressive temples and historic sights than its counterpart in Kathmandu. Don't visit Nepal without seeing both, however, as each has something to offer.  A pleasant thing about Durbar Square is that one isn't hassled, or at least not too much, by persons offering to act as a guide, sell one souvenirs, etc. Be sure to bargain with taxi drivers, as they will almost inevitably try and overcharge you. The same applies to shops and stalls selling handicrafts, Pashmina shawls and souvenirs. One can end up paying very considerably less than what the seller initially demands. A good time to buy is nearing the end of the day. Traders find it hard to avoid the temptation to make one last sale and some real bargains can be obtained in these circumstances."

The temple at the square is very old and the carvings are erotic. Have a good look. Vendors and shopkeepers do not overcharge if you can bargain. I find it bad that western tourists have to pay to visit this place when anybody else can walk in and out. School kids are everywhere, one cannot take a decent picture of a monument or statue without some kids sitting on it. This was the same in Bahktapur where I had regretted that I had paid 10 euro when I saw that so many walked in without paying. A visit to the museum still has to be paid extra anyway. In Patan, they try to avoid that people walk in without paying (only if you look western, speaking of discrimination) by obliging you to hang the large ticket around your neck. Just awful. It spoiled my appreciation of this wonderful old place, having this thing around my neck. I felt like an animal for sale. Why not make the entrance free for all without discrimination and charge for separate visits of the temple, the museum, etc... Tourists are more than just milk cows that are only good for their money."

It was very interesting just walking through the various laneways and courtyards (bahals) just seeing how the local people live. One site that was very impressive but just outside the main Square was Mahabuddha Temple where there are according to the locals more than 9,000 stone carvings of Lord Buddha. We had a nice lunch at the Vala Layekh Kitchen which was just opposite to the main entrance and overlooking the Square.

For a start, we got up early and caught the stall owners setting up stall. We had a great time browsing and do friendly bargaining with the stall owners. After that, we strolled into the square. There were no barriers nor signage indicating that we are indeed entering the square.  A short way into the square and after 2 photos, it was just past 9am, we were stopped by a young lady who asked if we have had tickets. We didn't so we were told to purchase tickets. I went to get my Dad and daughter to go purchase the tickets but my Dad decided not to as he strolled the square yesterday evening and that there is nothing much there. Then, we were approached by the girl's superior (probably), a large young Nepalese. When we said that we have decided that we do not want to purchase the tickets, he got really aggressive, asked us why then are we in the square! (There were no indication of boundary in the first place!!!) Then he told us to leave the square immediately. The girl told him that we have taken photos and told us to delete them! Wow! What a lousy experience.  I mean, I was with my parents who are close to 70 years old and a 11 year old girl, is it necessary to be that rude? It just totally spoiled it for us.  If you have been to Kathmandu Durbar Square, I think you can skip this as this is probably only 30% the size of Kathmandu Square. The entry fee at Kathmandu Square is Nepali Rupee 750 and here it is 500.  Save your money for a nice cup of coffee or tea and avoid spoiling your holiday by a rude gorilla.  We were informed that the fees are only applicable between 10am to 5pm by the hotel operator later."

Although the square is relatively small, the buildings are intact and so rich in detail as to keep you busy - especially if you're a photographer - for hours.  Roughly speaking, on one side are the royal palace buildings, and on the other side are the various temples, including one in South Indian or 'shikara' style, built of stone and dedicated to the god Krishna. The other wooden temples are in Nepalese architecture, some with erotic carvings on the roof struts. There are also a couple of metal statues on poles in the square, and plenty of details on the buildings to keep the visitor absorbed.  Various architectural styles are presented, with fascinating stories of various features. Pay for a local guide - it's well worth it, as much of the richness of the site is not apparent otherwise.  This is the authentic Nepal before development and traffic made the Kathmandu valley the sorry mess that it now is."

Whenever I'd feel a little under the weather, I'd go for some noodles soup and there is a difference when it is pho (authentic) vietnamese. I'd repeatedly ordered beef pho. I like it best with sweet basil leaves but unfortunately, these are not popular in Nepal and their alternative is lettuce leaves, some overgrown bean sprouts which can be very hard...so last resort- just to finish the bowl without the leaves. I always order an extra bowl of clear broth because it gets finished first before the noodles. Gulping down that soup always makes me feel better afterwards.  Other family favorites are the fried spring rolls (veg), fried chicken wanton (although they appear to have more flour crust than chicken filling, but the children love the crunch anyway). We've tried their steamed fish, curry. The newly introduced BBQs on weekends -- well, they can be overdone. Maybe more training is needed for the one incharge in the grill. We like that they serve fresh coconut juice that comes with the coconut shell. We just wish the coconuts were younger so you could still eat the cocomeat afterwards. They are the only restaurant I guess that serves caramel flan as dessert. Very Asian!  The restaurant interiors need more lighting but nevertheless cozy. Eating al fresco is an option but other client's smoking can bother you especially when children are around. The owners are very friendly and checks on diners occasionally.  We love their mint lemonade, iced tea and of course the vietnamese coffee!"

As I live in Kathmandu as an expat, I can say the food and service are consistently very good and it is good value for money. The dish I order most often is the Thali - they call it something different on the menu but ask the waiter or look for the description of various small dishes (cured vegetables, pickle, paneer cheese and rice) served on a platter - vegetarian or meat options available. It is delicious and presentation is super. If you are interested in trying something totally unique drink wise, ask them to demonstrate the pouring of the local Aeyla. The better quality ones Yala serves are actually very smooth to drink - the cheap stuff in other local bars tastes as if it could clean limescale off water pipes. The biggest problem is to find the place. There are no street names and local people don't know it or send you to a different place so here is my recommendation for a wonderful afternoon in Patan which culminates at Yala for dinner! First, visit Patan Durbar Square, a world heritage site of ancient temples and King's palaces. Do stroll around the nearby market - spices, metal items and flowers for temple offerings. After that, use GPS or your tour guide/ local person to get you to the Golden Temple. This is a fantastic temple to visit - one I take all visitors to - it doesn't disappoint. A guide is useful as there is so much crammed into the small courtyard and you could miss and/or misunderstand much of the symbolism. Afterwards, as you exit Golden Temple turn right, stay on this street - and it's a 2 minute walk to Yala. It will be on your left side and there is a freestanding temple structure almost outside it. The sign is easy to miss -- keep a keen eye for the word Yala! Spend your evening enjoying the great food, outdoor candelit dining available, and friendly service. The staff will point you in the direction of the best place to get a taxi. It's easy to get a taxi ""from"" here but not ""to"" here."

Very mildly sweet and yumm and oh so refreshing.  Next was Kachemba.... buckwheat fries and so yummy and crispy. I polished off the plate while chatting and I had claimed as soon as I got in that I was stuffed.  Husband loved the Sargemba. Blood pork sausages, and he seemed like a very very happy man.  Being a pastry chef.... I just had to try the dessert. We had the Raithaane pie.... it’s a yougurt based cheesecake (made using the famous Bhaktapur yogurt) and the crust was with Tsampa flour.

I was fortunate to discover Silk & Salt early in my stay, and quickly became a regular during my time in Kathmandu. I worked my way through the majority of the menu, and did not have a bad dish. Silk & Salt has an innovative and tasty menu, a nice selection of cocktails, a very nice space with an outdoor garden, and above all a fantastic and welcoming staff. The only place nearby that can compete is Yala, which I did visit occasionally for their pasta. I preferred Silk & Salt.  Food: Small but interesting menu made up of dishes inspired by destinations along the classic silk road, all with a Nepali twist and adapted to the available ingredients. Many dishes are inspired from Thai, Pakistani, Myanmar cuisines. My personal favorites were the tea leaf salad, the chapli kebab burger, and the cashew chicken. The breakfasts were also fantastic and were a welcome start to the day.  Space: The indoor area is a nice cross between a trendy coffee bar and french bistro, with plenty of good spaces to sit and read a book. They always had a good soundtrack playing as well. There is also a large outdoor space with a nice Nepali garden area. Overall the space was very chill, relaxing, and was a welcome break from the daily chaos of Kathmandu.  Staff: Saving the best for last, the staff at Silk & Salt were all fantastic. The owners recently settled in Kathmandu and opened the restaurant, and are intimately involved in the daily business. They have a extremely and inspiring story that ultimately led them to Kathmandu, but I'll let them share that with you themselves. The rest of the staff are young, extremely kind, and eager. I was always greeted with a sincere smile when I walked in. They were attentive and were fantastic at their jobs.  At the end of the day, if you're near Patan this is definitely a place you should check out. I highly doubt you'll be disappointed."

I got into the habit of observing myself and gained mental calm that I want most!(I'm Pitta-Vata) I continue to do yoga what I learned here. Even after returning to Japan, I continue to experience the fact that mental and physical purification occurs in relation to each other.  The staff here are all kindness. They welcome with a smile anytime. Technique of treatment, meal, cleanliness etc. great facility in all. I recommended all of the people who is seeking a better life! I will definitely come back here again♡  私はここで、3週間のパンチャカルマ治療を受けました。それは、私にとって初めてのアーユルヴェーダの治療でした。 結論から申し上げますと、それは素晴らしい経験でした。人生が変わりました。 具体的には、生理に関する悩み（PMS、だらだらと続く等）は解消しました。 腰の痛み、頭痛がなくなりました。自分自身を観察する習慣が身に付き、精神的な穏やかさが手に入りました。それは、私が最も求めているものです。（私はpitta‐vataです） ここで教わったヨガを帰国してからも続けています。心身の浄化は、相互に関連して起こることを体験し続けています。  Mokshaのスタッフは、みなとても親切です。いつも笑顔で迎えてくれます。 施術の技術、食事、衛生管理など、全てにおいてすばらしい施設です。 よりよい人生を求める全ての人に、Mokshaをおすすめします。 私は、必ずまたここを訪れます！！"

An important part of the wellness system is periodic panchakarma, an intense 28-day journey to restore your whole person to your original self (physical, energetic, spiritual, mental, emotional). I have previously completed full panchakarma in northern India (28-days) and small periods in Kerala (5 to 14 days); so, I have some perspective for comparison.  Moksha Ayurveda and Panchakarma Center is an amazing place! The treatments are authentic to the historic model and the facilities are a great holding space to do the work you come to do. The staff, however, is what makes this Center a profoundly healing womb. To a person, they are knowledgeable, compassionate, and deeply caring. They are clearly family to each other and support you in your journey of restoration.  For a single treatment, a short-term stay, or full panchakarma, Moksha Ayurveda has my highest recommendation. I am so very grateful for their nurture and support."

If you’ve never had an Ayurvedic oil bath, you have not fully lived! This exceptional treatment, which is their end-of-panchakarma ritual, is unlike anything I have ever experienced, and I am still walking on air, enjoying a lightness of body, mind and spirit that was my intention and desire when I initially booked the program.  I simply cannot say enough good things about Moksha. A few years ago I’d had a panchakarma elsewhere, but it was not a residential program and this time around I wanted a place to stay where I could fully immerse myself in the experience… and Moksha exceeded all expectations. The first and final word to describe my experience here is “nurturing”. Because Moksha is a small, intimate place (currently only 2 rooms for residential programs although they have plans to expand just slightly to 4 rooms, and many people just come in for day treatments) you are nurtured on every possible level… body, mind, emotion and spirit… and this is the true purpose of a panchakarma, to connect with, purify and heal every aspect of your being.  In retrospect, I really wish I had made more time to do a longer course of treatment, as 7 days really just begins to graze the surface. Regardless, Dr. Padma did a beautiful job of discerning through our consultation what my primary goals and concerns were and addressing them during my week.  The treatments themselves were incredible. They have a staff of practitioners whose caring hearts and hands make sure you are being maximally nurtured during each massage (so many different types!) scrub, cleansing process, chakra healing etc. Even the necessary but more unpleasant treatments were done with ultimate care and there was nothing that felt routine about any of it. Each moment felt as if it was being done and given to me for my specific needs and particular specifications. I felt deeply cared for.  And then there was Sanjay. Each morning I had two hours of personalized yoga and pranayama as well as some beautiful discussion time about philosophy (yoga and life) and as a yoga instructor back home, this was particularly impactful for me. He is an incredible teacher with a wealth of knowledge, but perhaps more importantly, his energy is as warm and pure as it gets. My time with him in conjunction with the cleansing and purifying treatments themselves was exactly what I needed at that moment in time, as I had just come to the center after a particularly impactful spiritual journey and needed the appropriate space and support to help me integrate the experience.  The food… what can I say. It is authentic Ayurvedic food cooked with love, specifically for your needs to nurture you from the inside out. Delicious.  The center itself (treatment rooms, residence, reception, dining area etc) is impeccably clean and the rest of the support staff was also exceptional, helping in any way possible to make my stay more pleasant. On the morning of my departure Sanjay made sure I had food before my early morning flight and some extra apples for me to take on my journey… so sweet. The whole experience was incredibly personal and touching and I can’t remember ever being so attentively cared for in this way.  Leaving the center and in the days following, I feel so incredibly good. The Ayurvedic system of treating and caring for the entire human system… mind, body and spirit… is highly effective if done right. If you are thinking about doing a panchakarma or getting any sort of Ayurvedic care, it is well worth your while to come to Kathmandu and spend your time and money at Moksha, and after being there, I wouldn’t dream of getting Ayurvedic therapy anywhere else. There is absolutely no question that I will be back, and I look forward to it. Thank you Moksha team… you are all a real blessing."

First I met the doctor and it was very good meeting. I got lifestyle advices plus yoga and pranayama teaching. In December I spent 10 days there with classical panchakarma treatments. It was once in a lifetime experience and I felt so much better after the panchakarma program. People in the center were lovely and they treated me very well. I got pure and healthy Ayurveda meals plus clean and homey private room (with a comfortable bed) next to the rooftop. All the treatments were very relaxing. I also got yoga and pranayama teaching during the panchakarma program. Now, 4 months later, I'm still continuing the practices because they help me to feel energetic and peaceful.  It was a gift from me to myself that I walked into Moksha Ayurveda and Panchakarma Center. I learned a lot about my body, mind and soul and I had an opportunity to meet genuine people who are like family to me now. They helped me to love myself and share the love with other beings. This place offers healing environment, treatments and meetings for the people who's willing to feel more alive. I'm happy that I went there and I can warmly recommend it for everyone. Go and experience ღ  See you again in full panchakarma session!"

It is very rare for one to find people so honestly dedicated to helping one's health holistically, so in love with life and with such warm hearts. The team is competent, friendly and genuinely caring. Both of us have never experienced better massages. My boyfriend is in owe of Ram's skills, for example, but this knowledge applies to all other therapists too. The therapies and food are pure healing for the spirit, body and mind with very strong positive effects. They are both individualized, after a thorough consultation, and are adjusted based on the experience of the guest. The place itself is a small island of peace, perfect for contemplation, relaxation and internal silence. We enjoyed absolutely everything and would love to go back there as soon as possible. Thank you, Moksha team, you are all very special people running a very special place :) Big hugs, Denitsa and Denis"

After one week I'm very happy to say that my anxiety was completely misplaced. I did the full spectrum treatment, detoxification diet, daily yoga and meditation, massages and healing therapies. For someone who was initially sceptical about the benefits of Ayurveda I am now fully converted!!! The simple techniques I learnt during my week will bring huge benefits to my life in terms of managing my stress and bringing overall balance to my daily routine. The accommodation was very comfortable, providing a quiet stress free environment in which I could focus on some quality 'me time'.

There are three times offered for the class, which is very flexible, and we opted for 9am. At the start of the class we were offered the menu choices, and opted for chatamari, daal bhat and chocolate momo.  The location is great - the corner of an interesting complex in a quiet part of Patan, with a courtyard just outside where you can enjoy each dish as you cook it. We were staying in Patan and enjoyed the walk there, but 2Sisters also offers free pickup from Thamel.  The food we cooked with Shusma's help was super delicious! I was surprised at how quick and easy the chatamari was to cook. After eating lots of daal bhat during our travels, it was great learn how to make it ourselves, and the daal was sooo tasty and lovely and thick - no watery half-cooked version here! I didn't think we had room for chocolate momos but the high quality chocolate and ratio of pastry to chocolate to butter was perfect, we had no problems at all scoffing them down. :)  Shusma is a lovely host, we felt comfortable in an instant with her, and she is very kind and supportive. You really don't need to know 'how' to cook as she will guide you through the whole process. The time passed so quickly, just chatting away, making funny shaped momos and exchanging thoughts about our lives and travels. It was great to get more insight into Nepal from a local.  Shusma's kitchen is very clean, and all the ingredients are organic and high quality. There is purified water for drinking and preparing the ingredients, lots of soap and water for your hands, hand sanitiser, and aprons and hats for everyone cooking.  Finally, I need to mention the delicious masala tea we made and enjoyed at the start of the class. It was so warming, great on a chilly November morning. I am dreaming about that tea back home!  This is a great activity for anyone who loves food, whether you are an experienced cook or a complete beginner. All you need is a positive attitude and an empty stomach! Thank you Shusma for such a memorable experience."

Shusma, the teacher is, as everyone says, fantastic and has had an incredibly interesting life. 2 Sisters will pick you up and ferry you off to the school which is in a lovely suburb of Kathmandu. Nestled behind a villa, is the school with a perfect set up. We were not interested in going to someone's house to learn to cook and this is an actual set up where everyone has their own cooking station.  As mentioned, there are a variety of menus to choose from and I found Shusma to be helpful, encouraging, and very patient. Making the very popular Momos is not as easy as one would think.  I definitely had a fun afternoon and would highly recommend this experience. It makes me want to do this everywhere I go, but I suspect this is a hard act to follow. Do yourself a favor and sign up for a class. Shusma really is fantastic and has a down a great job with the school.

Shusma is a great teacher and goes through every step to make the perfect Nepali dishes. We even went to the local grocery shop to buy the ingredients before, where Shusma showed and explained to me the different vegetables and what they're used for. This gave me a real insight into Nepalese cooking. You are also given so much flexibility to choose the dishes you want to make (starter, main and desert). Finally a percentage of money she makes at the cookery classes goes into Women's empowerment- so definitely talk to Shusma about this as she gave me so much insight into the caste system, gender equality and what it means to be a women in Nepal."

We made chatamari (Nepalese breakfast pizza!) which was delicious. This was followed by a master class on momo's. They are both so welcoming and friendly. An amazing way to spend a relaxed afternoon in Kathmandu. Highly recommended!

Making nicely shaped momos is very hard if you’re not used to making dumplings or tortellini, but the sisters kept it entertaining. They have a good sense of humor and make the class feel relaxed."

We were 5 people in the class and chose to cook the Chatamari / Daal Bhat / Chocolate Momo menu - apparently the most popular one.  You start off by visiting the local store to buy the fresh produce to cook with, and then move between cooking in the well-equipped and immaculate kitchen to enjoying the fruits of your labours outside in a beautiful sunny garden.  The food is delicious and plentiful, the teachers are full of energy and laughter, and it is a wonderful and uplifting way to spend a morning or afternoon in Kathmandu. I highly recommend it!"

Saw a new Indian cuisine restaurant, the name was catchy and boasted about having only 2 restaurants one in Washington DC and the other in Kathmandu. So this place seemed nice from the outside hence we went in. Well i am still regretting why did we go in there ? Well when you go to a fine dinning restaurant especially Indian Cuisine there are a few expectations. They did not meet any of them. Starting with their veg menu did not have any spicy paneer item. That is still bearable. We ordered our food. In the mean while we were expecting papads which are usually given prior to your meal. We got them but we had to ask for the same. Then any indian restaurant does give you a main course plate with a side plate as well. The shocking thing was that their main plate was the size of the side plate and no side plate was provided. We ordered rotis as 3 plus 3 so that we get hot rotis but the service was so poor that we were left lingering for about 15 mins after the first round of rotis were finished. The food was average nothing great. Then when we asked for the cheque in any indian restaurant you do get a finger bowl or there are tissues on the table. No finger bowl was provided neither was any kind of mouth freshener .  The overall experience of dinning was extremely disappointing and would not go again or recommend any one unless they make drastic changes."

They also serve delicious side achaar (spices) with every meal, my personal favorite being the lapsi (Nepali plum). The quality is always constant, I have never been disappointed a single time. It's probably one of the best Nepali restaurant in town and definitely my personal favorite one!  But it's not only the great food that makes me come back again and again. It is also about the place and its people. The friendly owner and the smiling staff are very attentive and always give me a warm feeling of being taken care of.

The bruschetta had so much flavour; grilled slices of eggplant, zucchini and tomato are layered over bread, and splashed with just the right amounts of basil pesto and mozzarella. My fiancé had the gnocchi with the house wine and some apple pie for dessert (I was too full from the lasagne for any dessert). Coffee was pretty good too. Cibo's service is very helpful and quick.  In short, this is a restaurant that offers excellent and varied food in a decent price range and guilt-inducing comfort in a power-starved city."

I mainly go to attend to my online business. I really like the atmosphere during the day. There is ample electric plugins however in my experience the wifi is incredibly slow here in comparison to let's say 'Top of the World' cafe.  The coffee is very good, albeit it should be heated more. The food in all three meals was very delicious (Nepali dishes). I haven't tried the western food yet.  During the daytime it would be wonderful if the staff closed the door that is always open on the main street as it creates a lot of noise in a rather peaceful cafe.  Dinner I won't return. Not because of the food or service, but because the lighting is atrocious (not much different than most Nepali restaurants). It would have been nice if they used soft 'warm white' bulbs instead of the horrid aquarium/daylight bulbs and perhaps tall reading lamps for ambiance. Not very romantic when I brought my wife.  The service is always friendly and at one point the manager or maybe owner approached me looking for feedback. That is rare in Nepal, so stars for that. Hopefully he listened!  All in all, for me to return regular, the wifi needs to be improved and perhaps the password changed weekly to avoid others 'hanging' on the system (including perhaps staff?)."

I think what I liked about Tamarind was that the waiter took my vegetarian tastes seriously, and after talking to the kitchen, let me know that the veg Thai curries are not really vegetarian because some non-plant items are mixed in from the very start into the dish. The kitchen customized a vegetable curry dish, but did not use coconut or tamarind, so it ended up kind of bland. Pity. Oh, and the price they charged for going off-menu for such a bland dish was double the price on the Thai curries, so it was a bit ridiculous.  I also ordered a lemon with honey drink but that was not a hit with me either. The seating is nice - they have comfy pillows on all the booth seats. The non-stop sports highlights on the TV screen and the bar atmosphere don't add anything for me but the noise level was quite bearable."

I wanted to give this a 5-star review, but can't for a few reasons.  Although the towels were clean, the cover on the neck pillow and the sheet under the towel felt clammy and weird, both being made of some awful synthetic stretchy stuff with obvious oil residue. No doubt they had been washed, but still. Also, the carpet in the treatment room was oily and awful. Carpets don't belong in massage rooms. The slippers in the bathroom were really oily and dusgusting.  Also, I asked before I came whether the girl giving the massage was experienced with sports injuries and was told that she was. However, she was a student and had only been giving massages for 1 year. She was really sweet and I did feel she did a good job of what she was trained to do, though, and to be fair, it definitely helped, so I can't complain on that level. However, some things she said gave me a strong impression that their training could be more complete. It was surprising that she had trouble understanding that I needed a wet towel to wipe down in order to avoid getting my clothes oily.  But it's a great initiative and I hope they keep expanding."

Staff were very professional and accommodating. We'd have preferred to both be massaged by women but there was only one male and one female working so be aware they may not be able to fulfil requests for a male/female masseuse. There is one massage table per room but they left a connecting door open at our request which helped me feel at ease.  Massage was really good and my masseuse checked in with me regularly to see how the pressure was. The price for 60 minutes was 1800 NPR (£13) which I thought was good value for the quality of the massage.

I have had massages from Ram and Swastika, and both are excellent. Ramji truly cares and worries about the state of my back, and his skills at making it feel better are unreal. I usually judge the quality of a massage by whether or not the masseur is able to find out where the pain is without asking - Ramji consistently delivers on this.  I have never had the relaxation massage, but the sports massage is probably the best therapeutic massage in town, and in 10+ visits I am yet to be disappointed."

Ramji was careful to adjust the strength of the massage to the right level to combine power and relaxation. The place is clean and, for me, a good point is they don’t bother with the dolphin sounds or ethereal music. Instead we had an interesting chat.  Seeing Hands seems to have a nice model of formally training masseurs with proper skills and then opening up new clinics to employ them in.  The setting for the Patan clinic is peaceful on the top floor of a house set back from the road. The entrance is next to a Toyota showroom and there are some signs along the road.  It’s probably best to phone in advance to make an appointment."

Try as I might I could not find a chiropractor in Kathmandu. Fortunately, I packed pain killers and muscle relaxers, but they were only temporary fixes. With a day of sightseeing ahead of me, I thought I should start with a massage. Looking on Trip Advisor, Seeing Hands was the most highly recommended. However, that was not the determining factor. The fact that the massage therapists were blind led me to believe that that their other four senses, especially touch, would be particularly heightened, which would only enhance the massage experience. I was not wrong.  Seeing Hands has three locations; one, in Patan, was a five minute walk from the Himalaya Hotel where I was staying (Exit the hotel, cross the street and turn left. Go two blocks and turn right. Walk about 300 feet. The Norwegian Embassy is on the right, Seeing Hands is just up ahead on the left.) It also happened to be the newest location and the least expensive of the three. The facilities were immaculate, cleaner than my hotel.  I was met at the gate by Ramji, my massage therapist. His English was excellent. He asked me if I had any surgery, medical issues or pain that he should be aware of. I told him of my back problems, so he spent a lot of time on my back. He sense of touch was intuitive. He completely hit on the 3 pain points on my back, especially the two really sore ones. When I left, I was virtually pain free. Even now, eight hours after my massage, my back does not hurt.  Back in the U.S. a 90 minute massage is way out of my price range. Here I can not only afford one, I can afford one every other day. I already made an appoint for Tuesday.  I would unequivocally recommend this place for a solid deep tissue massage, especially with Ramji, although I am sure the others are great as well.  One thing that I would recommend for Seeing Hands, as a few others have mentioned, is to keep speaking to a minimum and have some soothing meditative music playing. That would elevate the relaxation experience to another level."

And it was just as good as last time when I was there in February! He is skilled, professional, finds the nasty spots and works on them with different techniques. He uses as much pressure as I asked him for and made sure I stayed relaxed all the time and it didn’t hurt. He also didn't rush through some kind of standard treatment, but really did his best to help me relax in any way. I also appreciated that with Ramji you can either chat or enjoy the massage quietly (by the way his English is really good so it is easy to communicate). I have already fixed my next appointment – but you can also ask for a massage very spontaneously. I can very much recommend this experience to everybody."

When I walked down the road afterwards I felt as if I had grown by some inches and was slightly lifted off the ground, as he had managed to release my tensions by stretching and working hard on many a sore knot. I felt so much better! I would like to point out the professionally of the massage. According to my wishes he focussed on my back and neck during a 90 minutes massage but also found some nasty spots on my legs that I hadn't even been aware of but made a difference. I can confirm the experience that he found the very spot in my back that no other masseur had found before but had required repeated treatment by my physical therapist. He also gave me useful advice on further massages back home – but I doubt that I will find a similar quality and well-feeling there. I also appreciated that Ramji was adapted to all my wishes, whether I wanted to chat or keep quiet (by the way his English is really good so it is easy to communicate), whether I wished a lot of pressure or just little, etc. He didn't rush through some kind of standard treatment, but really did his best to help me relax in any way. I also never felt awkward to be massaged by a male masseur as he was very correct in any way (but usually a female masseur would also be available for females). The place is clean and quiet and there is a heater to keep you warm. So don’t miss this opportunity that is reasonably priced on top of all."

I made friends with a couple of German backpackers who had just finished a trek. They told me about this amazing massage they received in Kathmandu. I asked them for the name of the clinic and they told me all about Seeing Hands. I have had the privilege to visit their clinics in Kathmandu and in Pokhara. Both clinics were clean and the massages were incredible. During my last visit to Nepal in 2014 I had a chance to visit the new Lalitpur clinic... WOW. The first thing that I noticed about the new Seeing Hands clinic is how CLEAN it is. Tourists in Nepal resign themselves to spas that are not as clean as we would expect spas at home to be. The Seeing Hands Clinic is comparable in cleanliness to the spas here in Montreal. The only thing that is not comparable is the massage itself.... its even BETTER than the spas here. I have received massages on 5 continents and the massages I had at Seeing Hands are by far the best I ever had. They were supportive to my needs. After a trek, they were there to loosen up the knots. If I wanted a more relaxed massage, the obliged. I cannot recommend Seeing Hands enough. Give them a shot. You'll be back."

And, when families go out for lunch, one food that's always on the table is mo:mo. For the typical Nepali, a plate of good mo:mo with tasty 'achar' makes lunch (or even dinner) perfect. Having said all that, Bota - a restaurant specializing in mo:mo disappoints.  1. It is definitely not a quite place to enjoy your lunch, the constant sounds for tokens and all. Really, what's the use of having so many people working there? Pay-first is okay but I'd love to have my lunch (in midst of a hectic day) in a quite place.  2. Where's my achar? Now, Bota interestingly has countless pickles (or achars). Countless. Try this, try that. But, amazingly, the restaurant hasn't found the right achar that should go with the mo:mo. Give me one proper 'achar' and I'll be happy.  3. A bad experience: I ordered and paid for veg bara but I was served chicken bara. Well, if you think I was lucky, I don't eat chicken and it doesn't feel great to find out your bara wasn't veg bara after taking a bite.  4. For a pay-first, self-service, queue-up place with mo:mo and other variety food, the place is pricey. Definitely not worth the money you pay for.  This is all about Kamalpokhari Bota."

My stay with the Shakya family made all the difference in my experience of this city. They are a kind and caring family that do everything they can to facilitate your stay with them and your experience of their city. For example, I have some unusual dietary restrictions and was concerned about having them accommodated, but they have had absolutely no problem observing those restrictions (their cooking is fantastic, by the way!). Furthermore, they took account of my interests in Buddhist art and history and connected me to members of the community who could speak to those interests -- needless to say, I learned a lot!

They helped me with taxi arrangements and provided me travel tips. The location is also prime - close to everything but a block away so it's quiet. I liked the lovely balconies as well. The driving route google maps suggest from the airport to the guest house is not very accurate. The last part of the suggested route is actually too narrow for a taxi to pass so my driver had to ask around to find an alternative way. Maybe guide the taxi to Patan Dhoka (a white gate) and go from there."

The rooms are very comfortable, competitively priced and MUCH better value for money than places around Thamel and other tourist areas. It only costs ~ $4 for taxi into tourist heart of town, and ~ 10-20cents on buses.So its worth getting away from Thamel.

I also liked that the massage therapist kept on checking in whether or not everything was ok or if she was applying the pressure according to my preference.All in all, this was a truly rejuvenating exprierence and friends complimented me even days after how refreshed I looked.

Communication was fantastic in advance. The owner offered to pick me up from my hotel but I chose to walk. The spa is very clean and the services are well priced. I was served delicious herbal tea before my treatment. I had the most incredible pedicure (the lady who did it was so meticulous that she focused on every toe for about 10mins each). I was so impressed. Then I had a facial which was lovely. Again, the owners offered to drop me back to my hotel but I opted to walk to find dinner. I can't recommend this spa enough - lovely people, unbelievably clean, beautiful products, quiet and peaceful and good value. Try it!"

I visited the location on Jhamsikhel road, which I found very easy to locate and access. The grounds are very nice and parking is available. The facilities are nicely designed, very clean, and well maintained. Air conditioning is available for the hot summer months. The massage room was very relaxing with minimal lighting and a very comfortable massage table. The service was fantastic. So much so that I returned for a second visit during my short stay in Patan. I booked a 60-minute aromatherapy massage for the first visit and a 90-minute ayurvedic massage on my second. In both cases, the massage was amazing, but I'd recommend going for at least 90 minutes if you have the time. My wife also booked a facial which she found very enjoyable. The staff was very curteous, professional, and welcoming. Highest recommendation."

We came here to visit and see just what was left, and also to make a side trip to the nearby Karyabnayak Temple as-well. The feeling of being the only two visitors to the large open square, Villagers herding their ducks and goats through the old temple grounds actually added to the experience. I have always been a big archeology fan, so ruins excite me. These are relatively new, caused by a natural disaster, not time, although the original temples were in the 6-700 year old range. Visiting here is more of an exploration into the past. If a bunch of broken stones doesn't excite you much, I would skip this site. There's a lot of history , hundreds of small temples in the Kathmandu valley to explore. Most of the old shops and restaurants are gone, there is still one wood carver left here, turning out some beautiful HIndu and Bhuddist Statuary out of ancient pieces of wood that he imports from the Langtang region of Nepal. Worth the trip just to visit his shop."

Rato Machindranath's temple is usually in Bungamati but it was destroyed in the earthquake. Now Rato resides in Patan. The rath, or chariot is pulled to various spots in patan according to tradition and only moves when the priests say it is time. People come every day to worship the god and give presents to him - often for fertility. This is an 800+ year old tradition that makes Nepal such a special place. There is no charge to see the chariot and experience a traditional event."

Lagan Thura Stupa to the south is the largest. Recently a miniature cenotaph was added. Teta Thura Stupa to the east has fire Vedica with one Tathagata in each direction. The dome is paved with firebrick. There are three stone inscriptions which are severely damaged. Pucho Thura Stupa to the west has firebrick Vedika with one Tathagata in each direction. The dome is also paved with firebrick. The thirteen Cakravalis [rings] are constructed directly over the dome in a square shaped pyramid. An inscription reveals that the Tathagatas were in place in the 14th cent. Ibahi Thura Stupa to the north is nearly circular. It has 5 Buddha in the Vedika with their consorts except the Tathagata Vairocana. A square Harmika is constructed over the dome with 13 steps Cakravali and a parasol.

As you walk in to the city towards Durbar Square - you pass the pay point for the city (Rp 1500/person/day - but you can get an extension to cover more than 1 day).

Simple minimalistic design, attentive staff, good food and drink options too. A little pricey but I enjoyed my meal there. I tried the vegan carbonara and the cheesecake. The dessert was creamy, tasty, not overly sweet, reminding me of my mum's Easter cake. However, the pasta was a bit of a disappointment... the pasta was perfectly cooked Al dente but the creative attempt to veganise the sauce was killed by the use of mushroom stock cubes... What a pity! I would have appreciated simple flavours from natural herbs and mushrooms and not powdered flavour, which leaves your mouth dry and makes you terribly thirsty for hours afterwards. Otherwise, all good and the wine by the glass is also very well chosen. I could maybe give it another try, possibly other dishes rely more on natural ingredients."

The dish came with rice, lentil soup, and a variety of veggies and pickles. Presentation is too notch and the flavors truly delivers. I can not recommend the dish enough!  To top off your experience, the service is great. The owner was very friendly and recommended a few local restaurants around the Patan area. We really appreciated it!

There's a nice garden, and you can cook for yourself in the kitchen if you like. The guest house is neat and clean and well-maintained. Ruth is Swiss so they have an excellent understanding of what foreigners appreciate in a guest house. I can't say enough good things about them. The location is quiet and away from the hustle and bustle, yet within easy walking distance of some good restaurants."

The gust house is an old ordinary building. The recent renovation of the facade could certainly have been less modernist.

There are a handful of stores that I believe a Westerner would be interested in stopping by: Dukati (prices were really reasonable), Yala (had some luxury bath products and nice jewelry), Om, Sala (I was most enchanted with their blanket wool rugs as these would sell for over $1k in the US – NYC to be specific.) I’ll say, I found Om Handicrafts to be a bit sterile and at Western-like prices. Now did I buy something, yes, yes I did. I had wanted a 100% pure cashmere blanket and I thought in the United States these could range in the $400-800 price range depending on where you purchased. These at Om are part of a fair trade organization (which I prefer to support) and they had a masculine design to them (and I liked the chevron/herringbone/striped patterns in neutrals.) I paid $247 for a double bed size blanket (more for the couch in my particular opinion) and opted for a 4x4 weave. The less expensive weaves can be 1x1 (super thin) or 2x1 (medium to light weight and not as long or wide.) I will also say that the scarves that they offered are the same price as at Kopan monastery and look identical. And now that I have my blanket home, I'm disappointed to say that the edges are starting to show loose/frayed threads that are coming out of the blanket."

Wellness sanctuary is just on top of Cafe Chino ( you need to go to the courtyard through cafe) two mins after you come out from Patan gate.  It’s very simple, quiet and clean. The girls are sweet and well-trained. The whole atmosphere is just relaxing and safe.  I had the signature Wellness massage two days in a roll, because I could sense how my body felt during and after massage. It’s not forceful or too much pressure but deep enough to take care of the tension and fatigue of my body. After the first masssge, I immediately booked the second one next day. And had another wonderful experience. The girl masssged for me was so good. She found the tension stored in my body and helped to release it. I will definitely come back and book appointment everyday when I come to Patan next time. I traveled a lot and knows the value of this kind of masssgs. Thank you!"

The accompanying salad seemed like something they prepared for their goats and as an afer thought putit on our plate. The only saving grace was their special salad which was quite good and the portion good.

Deafen Me, more like!","I went to Grill Me with friends who had eaten there before and they thought it was worth another try. The restaurant is well laid out, service was fairly good, reasonable menu, etc. It should have been a pleasant experience.  However, all of the good points were drowned out by the extremely loud music of the live band. We literally could not hear each other without shouting. Perhaps it could be accepted in a late-night bar, but in a restaurant it is both ridiculous and a complete insult to the paying customers.  Our first polite request to the waiter to reduce the volume was listened to but not acted on, in hindsight probably because the waiters were intimidated by the players. When we pressed the matter with the waiter and he nervously told the players, they gave us a rude ""so you don't like our music?"", and then played an even louder song. When they finally took a break, it felt like someone had stopped hitting me about the head.  The food was reasonable by Kathmandu standards, acceptable by international standards. The seafood starter were nice, the other starters OK. I opted for pork chops, they were ordinary and harmless, maybe pork is not their speciality. No complaints about the food, but no great praise either. The meal was by no means cheap, but it was not unreasonable for western-style food.  I've given this restaurant 2 out of 5 as a fair balance between reasonable food, reasonable service, but dreadful customer treatment by the band. I would not visit this place again."

Although the place was set up nicely and we had one of those tatami rooms which I appreciated very much, the restaurant was unfortunately very near another restaurant which were belting out Nepalese folk songs LOUDLY. This killed the ambience. **It might have been better to visit in the daytime.** The waiters were quite attentive, although it almost got to a point where we felt like little daycare children being checked on in case we were doing something naughty- a smile would have been appreciated. Also it is on the pricier side. For 3 people, we spent about 3k but then it's at your own discretion. Inspite of all these, we thoroughly enjoyed the food. They are the most authentic and DELICIOUS Japanese cuisine I have found in nepal so far and that's the biggest point for me. I will be back for sure on my next visit to nepal."

Any concerns we had were addressed and he made sure that everyone made it to EBC in a very safe and comfortable way. He also made sure we were mentally prepared for each walk and that we ate well (especially for me, as I lost my appetite due to altitude). The accommodation were all booked in tea houses which were comfortable for us trekkers, it added to the experience as most nights we were in the main room playing cards and sharing stories.  We had a few extra days and booked the Chitwan Jungle Safari which added to the fun and wonderful experience in Nepal. I really recommend this if you have a few days to spare.

The service that was provided by this company was Superior! We were met at the airport in Kathmandu, and our transfer to the hotel Thamel with our luggage was very easy. Mr. Kabi came and met us personally, and introduced us to our trekking guide Ram. Ram is a very quality person, and obviously has a passion for his job as a guide. He was patient and caring with 3 women who were complete newbies to the whole trekking experience! He even tried to teach us some Nepalese, although we did not prove to be very good students. Ram was cheerful at all times, and greeted us always with a smile and attended to every detail and need we had during our trek.  We needed to make some changes in our itinerary while we were on the trek, and both Ram and Mr. Kabi worked together to make sure everything worked out for us. They are very concerned with safety, which was a good feeling for 3 women on this adventure.  The Tea Houses we stayed in were certainly adequate, and the food was nourishing and tasted good.  The only thing I would advise is that the trek itself is not as moderate a hike as made out to be. It is very steep a lot of the time, and you are going up stone stairs! I would recommend training yourself for some endurance before you go! Coming down the mountain is just as hard as going up! Be prepared for flight delays in Lukla, and the possibility of needing to take a helicopter out of there as we did if your travel is near to Monsoon season."

Overall it was a phenomenal experience, all made possible by the staff of the Trekking Guide Team Adventure. Shambu (our guide) was unbelievably helpful with his expertise in trekking (including how to handle altitude sickness) and there was absolutely 0 troubles in terms of communication. I must tip my hat again to Shambu as he knew where we were in terms of our fitness and definitely helped me out by carrying my gear when I was struggling.  In terms of the trek, everything (including the weather) went perfectly for us and words cannot describe how beautiful the landscape was the whole way (which changed almost in align with the seasons).  One thing I would recommend to anyone who is going to embark on this trek (which I hope you do) is to take extra money as food/water can be very expensive as you get further up the mountains. There are also little extra things you might want to spend money on (eg. showers (400 rupees), wifi (600 rupees/200mb), pringles (500 rupees). Also I would highly recommend for everyone to take diamox and water purification tablets up on the trek as well and to avoid all meats."

Last year, I went for Kathmandu City Tour with some hiking around the Nagarkot. This year I planned for short and easy hiking so I read blogs, reviews and articles related to short treks in Nepal and landed on Nepal Hiking Adventure site. After analyzing, I contacted company’s manager Bishnu Lamsal. He was so kind and calming, he answers my question very gentle and provides information on popular Nepal short treks. Finally, I landed on Mardi Himal Trek after listening to the amazing highlights of this trek. After On my arrival to Kathmandu, Nepal there was Ram who was going to be my trek guide to Mardi Himal. I find him very fun and caring type person. He asked how my flight was, did I eat anything or not. After reaching hotel I refreshed up and went to their company to discuss about the trip. They give me brief information about the trip. From the start of this trip, our tour guide Ram starts providing information of beautiful villages, their culture, monastery, Himalayan ranges and more. He showed us what we are looking for. He explore us around these local villages of Gurung and Magars. Truly learned great things from these villages and our guide. The trails was easy to moderate while ascending and descending was easy and fast. Along the way, I used to talk with our guide and porters. At teahouses he used to tell jokes and I have to laugh with them even though I can’t understand them. The great team of Nepal Hiking Adventure makes this trip of mine an unforgettable adventure of my life. I highly recommend this Mardi Himal Trek for those who want to experience Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges without spending long days of trekking. A great thank you to Nepal Hiking Adventure team and recommend to you all to visit this agency if you ever made your trip to Nepal."

Service of this Company was excellent and we got more then we expected. It was worth of every cent indeed...Our guide Ram together with Bishnu found solutions for every problem we encountered on our amazing trek to Base Camp Everest for we didn't have to worry about anything but enjoy our fantastic journey through astonishing Himalayan range. After this trek we spend some time in Kathmandu valley and team from Nepal Hiking Advanture Company provided the best service here as well. If you want not to worry about anything during your adventure and meet culture and people of this amazing country on the best possible way we would definitely recommend Nepal Hiking Adventure Company to guide you through. Best service ever and great people in the team who responded on our each wish and need quickly and efficiently. We got much more then we paid for...it was a lifetime experience indeed. Thank you guys for everything you did for us. We will surely come back again.

A prompt detailed email reply from Bishnu (Managing Director) told us that this was the company to go with. After further email exchanges we booked on to a tour and never looked back.  In Kathmandu we were met at the airport by our guide and later we were met by Bishnu in our hotel. He checked our gear and told us what we did and didn't need.  The tour itself was excellent. Zore was a fantastic guide and pointed out all the interesting viewpoints along the way. You see some stunning scenery along the walk. Each day you walk for 4-6 hours over hilly terrain. Some bits are a slog; some bits are thoroughly enjoyable.  Each day you have three meals provided, which are very tasty and very filling! The biggest surprise to us was the accommodation. Each night we stayed in a small hotel and there is the facility to charge your devices, have a hot shower and get wifi. These do have a small cost to them and get more expensive as you go further up the mountain.  We also spent quite a lot on drinks as these are not included in the price. An extra £200 for all of the above should cover you for the duration of the trek. Water is available at every stop but you will need purification tablets to clean the water. This might sound unappealing but it really is fine.  One thing to be mindful of, if you go in the off-season, you might get stuck in Lukla. At the end of a long trek, stinking in your clothes, you 'll want to get out of Lukla and back to the 'comforts' of Kathmandu. We had to charter a helicopter which set us back another $700 but Bishnu did return us the cost of the flight as this was cancelled. This is your choice as the flights are often cancelled during this time of year. There was a guy in our hotel cabin who had been there EIGHT days waiting for a flight. Didn't quite fancy that...  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the trip and Bishnu helped to make it as simple and easy as possible. He provided us with a letter to send off to our insurance company too because of the cancelled flight.  Thank you Bishnu and NHAC!"

After this I spoke to Kamal and said please do not speak about M like this. He said ""actually yes I should focus on him and not you as you've already come back"", I said ""no you need to treat us equally"". However from this time onwards the entire focus was on M, to the point of isolating me out of the group - I was the inconvenient woman on the boys trip  Itinerary After loosing the first porter to illness Kamal was forced to carry all the bags (~37kg) on his own for a day - we said we would provide feedback to the company that he should be compensated. We were told that the problem was caused by us choosing to walk from Salleri - we said we followed Bishnu's advice and we cannot be held responsible for the fact that porters can't be found at Salleri.  Later in Gokio I was told there was not enough time to climb Gokio Ri in the itinerary because not enough time had been left to return to Lukla & because I was too slow - why did Bishnu create an itinerary that was not achievable I asked Kamal - he said again it was because we choose to walk from Salleri - do you think anyone could give some sensible advice from this company on what to do on a planning a trek? As for being too slow Chola Pass - Kamal's estimate 10-12hrs - my time 8.5hr; Crossing Gokyo glacier Kamal's estimate 3-4hrs - my time 2.5hrs. I could continue but the reality was being a boring woman I didn't stand a chance of arguing this.  Baggage Kamal had told us in Kathmandu on the morning of departure our bags could not be more than 15kg/person. We borrowed the hotel scales and ensured we met this regulation. The new porter (Kishore) was told by Kamal that the bags were between 26-28kg combined. Kishore complained within a day that the bags were too heavy. Kamal asked us to remove our items from the bags to reduce the weight. We said we were told 15kg in Kathmandu by himself and it's not our fault that he had told the porter a lower number and if he needed to pay more to the porter that was his issue to resolve not ours. We certainly couldn't be expected to throw our personal effects away. On the Chola Pass Kishore had less than 15kg to carry and offered to carry my backpack - taking his load to 20kg. After 10min he dropped my bags and again complained about the weight -  Roles We observed Kamal calling the porters ""Assistant Guide"" and asking them to do tasks of a guide - we provided feedback to the company that you cannot call someone by a higher title than they are being paid  Drinking The first of several drunken episodes with Kamal - he informed us that he was a very busy man in Kathmandu and had cancelled his training to take our tour. We were told this multiple times and our response was consistently - if you weren't free you should have told Bishnu because we did not specify who should guide us. Upon returning to Kathmandu we checked with the company on this and were told he had confirmed he was free to take the trip. I asked Ram was this to get a better tip? - and he laughed. We never mentioned tips or that there would not be a tip. Where the need to be manipulative and deceitful came from is a complete shock.  Kamal was drunk on a number of evenings. He was more focussed on playing cards, expressing how boring the trip was for him, telling clients to go to bed early (in retrospect that seemed odd to be sent to bed soon after dinner) and commenting on Japanese women. It is not the clients job to entertain the guide and to be continuously told how bored he was - offensive is all that can be said. The height of his issues with alcohol was at Gokyo - the eve of climbing Gokyo Ri I was trying to express I was scared, I could not breath and had not slept. He was so drunk he said to another tourist that Choyong was the highest mountain in the world. He could not be reasoned with nor could he help with the issues I faced. The owners of the Fitzroy Inn (excellent and worth the extra $) also confirmed he had been drinking all afternoon. On communicating this to Bishnu he said he had no idea where this behaviour had come from. Back in Kathmandu speaking to Ram he admitted the company was aware of previous issues. How an organisation can know such information, pretend they don't know and endanger people's lives at altitude is beyond comprehension.  Harassment ""Chinese Food, Italian Suit, American Life, Japanese Wife"" - ""Japanese girls eh eh eh??"" I expressed disappointment at Kamal speaking about women in this way. This continued throughout the trip and was even said to a Japanese woman’s face. I understand in this culture similar to my Indian culture - women are not valued. However, when you have international clients where #metoo #timesup is at its height – time to educate yourself Bishnu - it is never acceptable for your staff to speak about women in this way.  The night before reaching Lukla a drunk Kamal and sober Kishore ganged up on me at dinner and said ""tomorrow is the last day and porter wants you to know that you have to give a tip. Of course it's your choice but really you have to give a tip."" Next morning I told Kamal I have never been spoken to in that way and Kamal said it was his first time a porter has behaved in this way. I responded ""it's not however your first time for getting drunk"". At Lukla both were told there would be no tip - if I was white or a man no one would dare to speak to me in this way nor would they dare to speak to me drunk. I had to lock myself in my room in Lukla. Bushnu did intervene and I did appreciate that however what he said was that we could discuss everything in Kathmandu, knowing full well he would not be in Kathmandu.  Customer Service Imn fact at the same time he was sitting with my friend (who had evacuated out) at dinner saying he was leaving the next morning to (“check accommodations for upcoming groups of about 20 pax“) as it was almost 2 years since he'd been on the mountain. How can you be in this business and not visit at least yearly? On return to Kathmandu Ram was sent (Bishnu did not admit he was not in Kathmandu or even apologise for not being present until I complained that “clearly as I wouldnt be returning as a client he sees no need to face me and hear any of this”) Ram's response was you've been through a terrible experience and I would have reacted like you to the demand for a tip but please don't put any of this on TripAdvisor. Really? I don't think that it is any organisations gift to ask for. Especially if they do not offer any kind of compensation until challenged and then it's a series of complaints that Kamal did his job by bringing me back to Kathmandu and just because the porter wants a tip and the guide is drunk I want to ruin Bishnu’s company. Seriously I have better things to do and it is irrelevant to me what actions you have taken against the guide – feedback good or bad needs to be accepted particularly if you do not have do not have have the decency to stick around to hear the feedback ."

The tour organizer (Bishnu) had everything arranged perfectly and in just 6 days we saw all the highlights of Kathmandu (temples, markets etc), went white-water rafting, stayed in the jungle which included an elephant ride, a canoe trip on the river and a trek through the jungle, a cultural dance performance, a hike up Nagarkot with sunset and sunrise views of the Himalayas, a tour of the amazing Bhaktapur and finally a night at a traditional Nepalese restaurant tasting some of the delicious local dishes. Simply amazing. I can not recommend this company and Bishnu high enough. The perfect tour guide and company."

We were promptly and warmly met at the airport by the owner who then escorted us back to a good hotel, with clean beds and warm running showers (which is quite a rare commodity in Kathmandu). Starting the trek entailed a lengthy bus trip to Jiri from Kathmandu, which isn't kind on the legs but is very scenic. Even on this bus trip we were welcomed in eating with our guide in the actual kitchens of people's homes, as opposed to cafeterias - which gave us an insight into Nepali life that I'm happy to say continued to be privileged us throughout our trek.  Trekking to Base Camp from Jiri is the only way to do it and if you have the fitness (it is occasionally gruelling) and time, then you HAVE to do it this way. There are fewer people trekking, you get to spend more time with the people (as they are generally more receptive to you sitting in their kitchens when there are fewer tourists), and the scenery is just remarkable. At all points our guides and porters were really supportive and attentive to our needs, and were keen to show us the interesting bits of the various cultures.  It was in the ability of Nepal Trekking to deal with emergencies, however, that really showed the quality of their guides and porters, and the quality of the company as a whole. I was stricken with AMS (acute mountain sickness) at Lobuche and became really ill, really suddenly. As a result of the disorientation I lacked the wherewithal to realise I was dangerously sick and so I probably would have continued trekking. Our guide, however, really took control of the situation - which is exactly what you need in what is definitely a high-risk scenario. He quickly spoke with the owner (who was based in Kathmandu) who then quickly mediated with our insurance company and had an emergency helicopter scrambled for us. The care and concern I was shown by the guide and porter (and indeed many of the other guides and porters convened at Lobuche) was indeed touching and was a further credit to them and the company. The decision and rapid action of the company prevented the situation becoming severe, and I thank and commend them for that.  Overall, the owner, the guide and our porter were a pleasure to be around and took care of everything, and our safety and comfort were always their paramount concerns. In a city that fiercely competes for your custom, I couldn't recommend Nepal Hiking in stronger or warmer terms."

The guide, jeep and accommodation are all of great quality which provides you the platform to sit back and enjoy the experience.  Being organised out of Nepal, the agency will arrange a local (English speaking) Tibetan guide which brings a lot more colour and depth to the commentary. Our guide also spoke a decent level of French.  I highly recommend including Everest Base Camp into your itinerary, it is easily accessible from the Tibetan side and the view is spectacular. I would also recommend packing some altitude tablets as a precaution, if you do head up to base camp you'll be sleeping at 5200m.  We organised the itinerary in advance which meant that we could leave the day after arriving into Kathmandu. Bishnu and his team arranged all the necessary paperwork and visas with information provided over email; passports were required one day prior to the tour to process the visas.  This was a great experience. The only way to visit Tibet is through an organised tour and from extensive research Nepal Hiking Adventure Company appears to be the best value for money."

After a downpour the day before I honestly don't know how he did it. Worth noting here that the local Nepalese on the tour were all lovely, friendly and happy to share their landscape - and even helped me get clean after a tumble into a puddle.  Our guide gave us the option to hike for a further two hours through the jungle after the first two hours, which we happily accepted - it was so worth it.  The Hindu temple at the end of the hike was great - dating back to 300 AD! The way that it has been restored is a testament to the skills of the local people as it has really kept its authenticity.  Needless to say, the sunrise coming up over the Himalayas was stunning, truly breakth-taking.  What was especially great about this tour was the private nature - no tour bus, just us and our private guide!!  Remember to take warm clothes for the morning and that can be stripped off for the heat of the afternoon. Also, remember $15 for breakfast at a mountainside resort."

After some sightseeing in Kathmandu we went to Pokhara to explore the city and to start the Nayapul-Ghorepani Gandruk trek. I really enjoyed the trekking and my trekguide Elmi made me feel very safe and comfortable. Also after the trekking he took care of everything that a tourist needs in a foreign country which made my last week touring around the cities another great experience. Elmi is a very professional and reliable guide who is always ready to help. You will not only see the touristic areas but also have the chance to take a close look withing the local culture when you travel with him. Thank you for everything Elmi! Ebru Gezer
