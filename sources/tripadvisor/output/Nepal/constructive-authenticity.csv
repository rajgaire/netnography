The Sun Dhoka was topped by a beautiful , golden pediment . At the apex of the pediment was a huge Kirtimukha holding his two long fangs with his two hands coming out through his majestic mane . Below the Kirtimukh was the family of Lord Panchmukhi Shiv with his console Parvati and sons Ganesh and Skand . This family was flanked by Makar torana , ( floral-reptile motifs )with two celestial makars depicted as one third terrestrial animal ( trunk of elephant ) in the frontal part , one third aquatic animal ( crocodile ) in the middle part , one third bird ( tail of peacock ) in the hind portion with extended floral tail .  There was a golden window above the Dhoka ( gate ) , once used by the king to make public appearances .The window enshrined Avlokiteshwara aka Karunamaya ( now known all over the world as Machchhendranath , a famous Hindu yogi ) surrounded by the pantheon of Hindu gods .  The old museum building was reinforced with concealed RCC beams & slabs and retrofitted with moisture resistant membranes to protect the walls and roof from dampness .  We first witnessed Shilapatras inscripted from 659 Ad to 1896 AD . Then we climbed new stair case in the eastern wing .  There we saw a ritual oil lamp with bronze donor figure made at Bhaktapur in 1870 AD and placed under terracotta nitche and torana .  Then we saw five Buddhist beautiful figurines showcased together :  The left hand side bottom most figure was of Chamunda / Kali / Mahalaxmi . It was made of Brass in 18th - 19th century in Nepal . Depicted as a skeletal crone as no other Goddess was , the fierce Mahalaxmi - also called Chamunda / Kali - could not be mistaken for any other female deity .  The left hand side top most figure was of Indra . It was made of Gilt copper in 17th - 18th century in Nepal . Indra , an ancient Hindu God reverred by all Nepalese was recognised by his horizontal third eye , in contrast to the vertical third eye of other deities . The right hand side bottom most figure was of Vajradaka . It was made of Bronze in 17th - 18th century in Nepal . The upturned face with gaping mouth identified Vajradaka , an earth spirit who devours ill influences . Tibetans sometime took medicine through his mouth .  The right hand side top most figure was of Yam . It was made of Bronze in 17th - 18th century in Nepal . Yam , a fierce Buddhist protector , "" King of Religious Law "" , and the personification of death was unmistakable because of his bull head and mount , the water buffalo , a combination shared with no other deity .  At the centre was White Tara of the Seven Eyes . This idol was made of Cold gold , Copper alloy , Gilt , Paint and Semi precius stones in 18th - 19th century in Tibet . This form of the Buddhist Goddess Tara was reognised by her five extra eyes , one on the forehead andtwo each on the palms and soles .  The tantric images of Buddhism , the deities are in sexual embrace . We appreciated two such images :  One such image of Yam and His Consort .This idol is made of Cold gold , Copper alloy , Gilt , Paint and Semi precious stones in 15th century in Tibet . Yam , "" Lord of Death "" and "" King of the Law "" united with his consort in the vigorous pose of the fierce deities . Both wear skull studded crowns , his was a garland of severed human heads ; hers was a girdle of humane bone . They were supported by Yam's mount the water buffalo . Originally a Hindu deity , Yam was eventually incorporated into the Buddhist pantheon as a protector .  Another image was of Chakrasamvara and Vajravarahi . This idol was made of Bronze and Gilt in 18th - 19th century in Nepal . When the esoteric Bodhisattva Chakrasamvara united with his consort Vajravarahi , the "" Dimand Sow "" , they represented the union of wisdom and compassion that is the actuality of enlightenment . This extreme multiheaded and multiaremed representation was characteristic of Tantric imagery .  We also learnt the Lost Wax casting process depicted detail by various photographs having commentary .  The visit to the museum is a MUST to know the cultural richness of Nepalese civilization .  Entry Fee : Included in Patan Darbar Square Entry Fee Timings : 10:30 to 16:30 Closed : Tuesdays"

The Royal Palace pretty much dominates the area in its granduer; the 16th C stone Krishna Mandira with 21 pinnacles dedicated the Lord Krishna does hold its own. But there's more: the Golden Temple and the terra cotta temple of Mahabouddha. By this time we were pretty much exhausted after three weeks of none stop travel. We gazed at all the above maybe more in a stupor than wonder. Now, by reviewing this extraordinary city, we fully appreciate what was to be our last great adventure in Nepal. Nameste."

It is about 40 minutes from central Kathmandu and there is an entrance fee to the main area. Patan is in Lalitpur district which is said to have been founded in the third century BC by the Kirat dynasty and later expanded by Licchavis in the 6th century. It was expanded further by the Mallas during the medieval period. Patan Durbar Square is listed by UNESCO as one of seven Monument Zones that make up the Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Site. Some Patan monuments were badly damaged in the 2015 earthquakes and work is continuing on rebuilding. But the Museum is outstanding and well worth a visit with excellent displays giving the history of Nepal. There are magnificent displays and the signage is in both English and Nepali. Lalitpur has the highest number of renowned artists and finest craftsmen ever recorded in the history of Nepali art. You can only marvel at the intricate wood and metal work as you move through the museum and admire the workmanship of the craftspeople. After visiting the Museum make sure you walk down the road to the Golden Temple - it was spared by the quakes. You can easily spend half a day at Patan and there are many cafes for lunch or tea. Well worth a visit and the entrance fee.

The building was largely spared by the 2015 earthquake, and its beautiful facade gives you an idea of ""what was"", and perhaps of ""what will be"" once all the renovations around are completed.  To enter the museum, you will walk through a maze of finely decorated courtyards. The museum itself is compact and well planned, with Hindu and Buddhist artefacts displayed in separate galleries. If you don't feel like an expert in local traditions and beliefs, then this is the right place to start. Most objects are fine metalwork depictions of deities, and insights into the metalwork craft - for which Patan was once famous. Photos can be taken inside.  If you decide to finish your tour at the museum, there is a nice cafe at the back courtyard where you can have a drink and relax.

There is two parts to the museum both included in the ticket price of 400 rupees. While the main museum through the golden door is intact the second half through a neighbouring door off the main square has had some damage from the earthquake but this doesn't seem to have had much in it anyway. Definitely make a visit here.  Tip: I paid 1000 rupees for a guide as I wandered into patan square, and apart from showing me where the golden temple is he wasn't worth the price (though he was a nice person). Definitely don't get a guide for the museum as I saw one person being shown round quickly by the guide and he didn't see much of the exhibits. Do it at your own speed."

The museum is housed in a wing of an old palace that that has been beautifully restored to create a thoroughly modern museum. The collection, mostly sculpture from the Kathmandu Valley, exceeds anything you can see in the western world.  The glory of the Patan Museum is its display. Not only is each individual object attractively displayed, the entire museum is intelligently organized around the goal of clarifying the numerous deities and religious inspirations that gave rise to Nepalese art. The helpful wall texts and labels are in fluent English.  We saw the Patan Museum in the course of a crowded schedule and didn’t have time to explore properly.

The exhibits are kept in excellent display cases with professional lighting. In my opinion this is definitely one of the best museums in Nepal.  There are panels showing how the metal is worked to make the exquisite metal idols that Patan is famous for.  There is a stiff entry fee (NPR 250 for SAARC nationals). BUT the museum is definitely worth it!!!!  Tip: Please spare a minute to climb up to the Bell Tower. You will get a Panoramic view of the Patan Durbar Square.

Spread across two of the historic buildings of Patan's Durbar Square, the museum is a definite must-see. The first building houses the exhibition areas and some of the artefacts and figurines in bronze, gilt and gold are stunning. The museum's incorporation into the old building, an ex-palace and monastery, during renovation has been handled with great care and there is little externally to suggest what you will find along the maze of corridors and floors.  The second building has no exhibits as such but is, itself, the exhibit with incredible carvings and features in its stone and woodwork. To the rear, there is a sunken pool within a garden that is being renovated.  The museum café is very smart and reasonably-priced. There are two museum shops. The items on sale are good quality and their prices reflect that. Don't expect bargain hunting here.  Signs in English, located near the items on exhibition, provide good explanations about the history, etc. of each."

Duck through the door in the middle of Dhurbar Square in Patan and enter into the museum courtyard. A second courtyard door takes you into the garden area and to the entrance stairs leading up to the exhibits. The place is exquisite, and done in typical Newari style.  Here, laid out in a very manageable format, is an incredible lesson in Buddhist and Hindu iconography, shown through a carefully chosen and exhibited selection of bronzes. One can either just enjoy a superficial view of some of the best bronzes or really learn about the attributes and symbolism of the different gods and goddesses that people the country of Nepal. Descriptions of the figures and pictured are clear and concise. The museum is relatively small, so the visitor is not overwhelmed by too many things to see.  Below in the courtyard the garden outside is a small restaurant, with tables tastefully placed under trees, near flowers or under a covered roof area. Food is fine - not overly gourmet - but an okay combination of Nepali (geared to non-spicy tastes) and western fare. Service is friendly, but can be slow, so be prepared. It helps to have a reservation during the busy lunch hours."

The museum is rich in cultural history and background of the evolutio of the Patan people in Nepal. The museum also portrays the significant contributions of ancient Patan people in the History of modern Nepal. Those who are interested in History and Anthropoly will find this museum nice. To me, it was just another local history museum. There are good food stalls outside of the museum. Do not miss the meaty offerings. They are mouth watering."

One of the most extraordinary collections of bronze figures is on display with very well done descriptions of the techniques used to create them. If you visit anything in Nepal - visit the Patan Museum!  There is a nice garden behind the museum where you can relax from the noise of the city, probably the most peaceful place anywhere in Patan. The coffee shop is beautiful but overpriced and the food is boring. Bring your own packed lunch and sit in the small garden or have a - also expensive but very good - lunch at Cafe Swotha only a few meters below Durbar Square!"

The exhibits are beautifully displayed, the interpretation materials brief and informative, supported by poster sized deeper descriptions that are worth the few minutes to read the well written text. The palace is peaceful, the lighting subtle, the exhibits subtly presented. One of the highlights is being able to sit on red window seats on the third floor, looking out on the Square through dark, carved window frames.

A traditional Newari city patan has a unique traditions as well as identity. As we were with my tour guide we were lucky to know most of the things that patan durbar square has. The Main durbar square is so unique with its wooden architecture as you see there so much wood work everywhere. The main house used to be the living place of the Malla Kings family in the past and there are many courtyard and Chowk inside. All of this Chowk has it’s own significance. Siddhi Narsingh Malla was the king who built many temples and part of durbar in 17th Century B.C. Krishna Temple was the another attraction over that squre which is built by the stone only in sikhara style which took 25 years to build by King Siddhi Narsingh Malla. The place also popular for buddhisim as there are a lot of sakya family and it has a lot of Boudha Bihar. Hiranya Barna Mahavihar is one of the popular. Overall our experience to patan was great with my guide Sabin as I learned many things. I tried the Newari food which was awesome but quite spicy. You must visit patan if you are coming to Nepal. Highly Recommended.

One can spot tea vendors, balloon sellers and souvenir stalls in the courtyards. It also has excellent roof top restaurants.  The complex has beautiful museums.

In the heart of old town we have a magnificent palace and 9 different temples.Collectively it is known as Patan Durbar Square.It reflects the skill and craftsmanship of the Malla period(1200 to 1768 A.D.). The natives,known as Newars have carved exquisite wooden windows and amazing stone temples and statues all around. The Keshav Narayan chowk(courtyard) has a museum that was set up by Smithsonian Institute.It is now partially damaged by 2015 earthquake but renovation is going on at full speed and everything should be ready in about a year. The inner garden has a delightful cafe as well. This part of the palace was renivated by the Austrian government(1983-1997). The Mul chowk(Central courtyard) and the private bath/ritual courtyard were done by US,UK,Nepalese and Japanese help. The Mul chowk has statues of the Ganges and Yamuna river with some fine wooden struts (with original colors) dating back to 17th century. The private bath complex is the oldest part of the palace dating back to 1610 A.D.It now has a gallery open with some frescoes.The inner garden area is a currently a workshop for woodcarvers (for renovation purpose) and it also has a lily pool with some stone figures. The main golden door leading to Keshav narayan chowk is flanked by two wooden benches where seniors sit and talk about nostalgia. Next to it is a water spout dating back to 570 A.D. and has two small resthouses. Bang infront of the golden gate is the stone temple of Krishna,the 1st Shikara style temple of the valley. The shiva temple next to it has some extraordinary wooden struts. The surrounding area has some restos and a small flea market and some souvenir shops. Just a minute away from Bhimsen temple in a back alley is Om handicraft which is fixed price and has some quality products. Overall the Patan Durbar Square is a wonderful area to visit."

Basically I wanted to explore and run some rivers on my Kayak. But during my visit there, I was told to visit this place by a friend. Just how wonderful Patan Durbar square is for a traveller to experience some of the tradition & heritage structures of Nepal. the oldest of the three cities in the Kathmandu valley. The square is made up of 136 courtyards and 55 temples. It was destroyed by earthquake few years back and some places are still under maintenance & rebuilding stage. However all the structures are amazing, heritage Hindu kingdom. There are a number of historic temples & they include some extraordinary erotic carvings on one of the temples in a traditional South Asian style. The Patan Museum is also simply amazing. Also the Mahabuddha temple is an easy walk from here. You might get lucky to witness some religious processions and performances in the square as well. Supposedly these are fairly regular. So if you want to time your visit accordingly may be you can contact the tourist office before visiting. As I was alone and also less crowd during the morning visit, I got absorbed and felt so spiritual. There is so much ancient culture in this thriving and beautiful place.  This is a must visit place for all travellers to Nepal. I ticked off another beautiful destination on my unknown places bucket list :)  I bow down to this land and the people of this land who have built & preserved this gem of a place for the world to experience."

They're also very skilled at what they do and accommodate Yogis of all levels (beginners and advanced students). Each teacher has their own style and flare, and I look forward to the variety and what I'll learn from each class.  The studio is well kept and is cleaned often. They have a bathroom which is always clean and tidy as well. They provide all the props you need for classes (mats included) at no extra charge. They also offer many different types of workshops; anything from healing bowl sessions to self-help seminars to Vinyasa Flow dance parties.  I've been attending for nearly 3 months now and truly feel like I have a family there. It also helps that its right above Himalayan Java which means lots of post-class coffee and opportunities to make new friends and have fellowship.  If you're travelling, stop by for a class!

The third instructor was extremely rude and unsupportive of a newcomer to the class who appeared to not have much experience in yoga - this was very surprising and off-putting and I will make sure not to take her classes again. The main issue with the Patan studio (I haven't used their other two locations) is that they cancel classes frequently, and often at the last minute. This month they have canceled eight sessions so far. It's very unprofessional and I don't think I will be renewing my membership."

Their premises are clean with plenty of props which are part of modern yoga experience. The instructors are professionals and helpful; some are better than others. Popular venues become very crowded, like the one in Thamel. The policy seems to be to accommodate everyone inspire of the cramped conditions. I have often ended up with my nose very close to armpits or crotches! The yoga hall in the Thamel centre is long and narrow-ish. The instructor and practitioners are all on the same level. Often, trying to observe what the instructor is doing becomes difficult. I have ended with more than a few cricks in my neck, undoing the benefits of yoga practice. They seem to have raised their prices as well. I hope I can keep up my yoga lessons."

The studio is located in Moksh complex in Lalitpur, very conveniently in between all the restaurants and coffee shops that make Patan so attractive. The studio is very clean and professionally managed. Most techers and students are westerners, which is a little drawback. If you want to get in touch with the Expat community in Nepal - that's probably the best starting point.  They offer drop-in classes by many different teachers which makes it very easy to try out the different styles of yoga. It's no problem for people without experience to join the classes, just come and grab a mat - that's finally what made me tryout yoga. Uncomplicated!"

The variety of teachers from many branches of asana practices ensures one can find a style and a teacher that meets what ever one is seeking from yoga practice. As a beginner yogi I did exactly this until I found the style and teachers that suited my needs. I can warmly recommend Chrissie Grogory´s Iyengar classes. With the emphasis on alignment and preciseness I have found them very suitable to learn asanas properly. Combination of Iyengar and Vinyasa Flow with wonderful teacher Lennette Boner has brought my practice to a whole new level. The monthly yoga celebrations and retreats are a chance to further widen the perspective and deepen the knowledge beyond asana practice. And a chance to make new friends!

As a chef and a person with a knowledge of the food industry I can honestly say that this was one of the worst dining experiences of my life.  I'll try be brief as I know how essay reviews are to read but seriously what I endured deserve one.  Yer well lovely looking place, nice sounding menu on the mid price range with some really tasty sounding options. Great. Lovely courtyard, perfect.  So my partner ordered the lasagna and I the Chinese inspired mushroom and pak choy. We had a great feeling as a place with great reviews and such a well presented location deserves high expectations. The lasagna came out only slightly warm and the middle still cold and as you can see from the photo not a lot of love to gratinate the cheese on top, a basic for any lasagna. We asked for it to me warmed and knowing a microwave would be the answer and sure enough after 2mins we received it warm of course but as expected the microwaved cheese leaking oil!!! Tasty!  My dish was actually very tasty exept for the 3rd bite including a rock. Okay, this for me is seriously unexectable, it is in no way a mistake, it tell me that the kitchen doesn't wash their pak choy!! This can pass for a street food dish but not a restaurant of this standard.  I called the waiter over, he took the dish away and then brought me the menu.... I of course asked for the manager. To be honest she handled the situation fairly well, after I suggested her to offer me a new complementary dish. The BLT that I ordered was tasty but really nothing special. Besides the fact that after the first bite she came running over to ask if ""I loved the new dish."" Seeing the waiters and the manager in the reflection standing around the cash register and looking over in my direction and laughing didn't help the already broken trust.  Wouldn't return and if I were you don't bother. Stick to a street side samosa."

I was served by Pawan and he went all out to make sure I was dutifully served by checking in regularly to see if I need anything else to be served (the seat location was well concealed by some landscape features so he needed to make effort to get to me). Awesome service it was! The food was nicely prepared and delicious too. Definitely one of the place to enjoy a good meal and quiet break from the bustling city.

He told us it will take timee 15min to warm the water .... ""do you still want it?"" .... we asked the momo 45 min before and they just dont want to tell us they forgot our command and a ""sorry"" its thing that happens but just ""sorry i forgot "" would be ok but nothing ....so we didnt take the momos  - the meal : vegeteble were not so bad but the fish was such small pieces with lots of oil .... and in the other side the hamburger was so dry ++ and untasty i didnt think it was possible my wife forced herself to eat the half ...and with the hamburger the bread didnt look fresh .... and with it 8 small piece of french fries miam miam  - then last we saw a expresso machine we sayed yeah a good coffee ...but its was not possible no electricity ....

When we went there, there were only a couple of us so I loved that it seemed so peaceful and quiet compared to the noise at the Durbar Square. The cafe is inside the Royal Palace and it is very interesting to find a modern garden setting in the middle of everything that's of Newari architecture.  The cafe is operated by the Summit Hotel so the service is expectedly very ""hotelish"" -- white napkins, well-dressed waiters, etc. It's not a complaint though but I've always liked to dine in places where it's more local and authentic. Nevertheless, the cafe is a very welcome break from all the walking around temples and red-brick houses. I loved that it was quiet and peaceful and of course, service was very prompt and very attentive.  There was very good food presentation, expectedly again! But I wouldn't say it's extraordinary. But it's not bad. :) We ordered Nepali food so just by that alone is already a big thing for us. Naturally, it's a bit pricey compared to the other ones.

I was lulled back over and over by the soups: potato and carrot, zucchini and carrot, cream of tomato…all served with a slice of brown bread that was some of the best brown bread I had in the entire country. Plus it was the first café I came to trust with fresh salad, i.e. organic greens, sundried tomatoes, black and green olives, and a light dressing. Nearly every day if not every other day, I came in and sat at what I deemed “the Chef’s table”, i.e. one of the barstools in the front entry way. The guys that work there are so sweet and if you’re traveling alone, strike up a conversation. These guys (3 of which are in their early 20s) are pretty outstanding in making your wishes come true. One day I wanted a mulled wine (hot wine) and boom – they served one up though it wasn’t on the menu. Another day I really was craving avocado and shazam…an avocado salad with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. It’s a shame that their online presence isn’t more prevalent for the foreigners who search the internet for recommendations because I’d go here any day of the week, (probably every day of the week) if this was a restaurant near my home. And I can guarantee you that if they ever come out with a cook book for soups, I’m the first one to buy in. They put places like Panera, Pret, Eat, etc to shame. Oh and by the way, I had the ham and cheese sandwich twice (yum – real cheese!), the spaghetti Bolognese (fantastic meat sauce), the pepper steak (ok this was alright – not my favorite piece of beef in Nepal – that was in Pokhara, but still good), and they make the best crispy French fries I had locally. And if it helps two big tips: 1. They are open every day 7am-10pm and 2. It’s a bit harder to find as it seems no one ever knows places that are even within a block of them…it’s very close to Café Pagoda in Durbar Sq, Coffee, Tea and Me, and Newa Chen B&B. Sometimes people know Swotha kiosk, but I found that every time I asked about Swotha Sq, not a single local knew what I was talking about. Guys – thanks for making me feel at home, always having a seat available for me, and keeping me company."

A guide accompanied us around the temple explaining the history and significance of the temple and many figurines , statues and paintings adorning the walls of the temple ,  This three-storey golden pagoda of Shakyamuni Buddha was built in the twelfth century by King Bhaskar Varman .At the entrance , we were confronted by two large brass elephants with riders , as the guardians .The brass and silver doorway was topped by a gorgeous repousse bass relief of the Buddha sitting in the Bhumisparsha mudra flanked by his two disciples , Sariputra and Mudgalayana . Afterwards there was a shrine adorned with a silver and golden chaitya .Behind it , there was a main shrine of Buddha .  Inside the shrine there was the bejewelled Buddha having an elaborate crown on his head . A huge Prabhamandal was intricately carved in gold on his entire body . Outside the shrine a beautifully carved panel showed various life scenes of the Buddha .  The design of the complex represents all the three main vehicles or Yanas of Buddhism . The main shrine represents the basic exoteric Shravakayana , the large Tibetan style image of Amoghapasha Lokeshwara on the first floor is the main Mahayanic deity . On the first floor , the principle Vajrayanic deity of the Kwa Bahah - Yogambara with three faces , black , white and red , and three eyes (each) was locked in a passionate embrace with his consort , Jnana Dakini . His first two hands held a vajra and bell . The remaining right hands caressed the breast of the consort and held an arrow. The left hands held a skullcup and a bowl . A jewel , crescent moon and vishvavajra adorn the black hair as an ornament , with a garland of five skulls and the five Buddhas as a crown , having the six mudras , wearing a tiger skin . Seated in the sattvasana , in the lap was the mother Jnana Dakini , white , with one face and two hands . The right hand held a katvanga staff and the left a skullcup - embracing the father adorned with the five mudras .  The Kwa Bahah is the repository of yet another famous text , the gold lettered Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparampita - a key Mahayan text written in India in first century AD .  Though one can not take photographs inside the shrine , she can spend hours together doccumating the various fascinating figurines and paintings along the walls ."

It is an absolutely amazing place to enter. Very powerful, very sacred, already from the gate. It was absolutely crowded when we visited since it was one of the biggest holidays that happen once every 4 years only but despite this, it was amazing to be there, feel the atmosphere and watch the people. If you happen to be there on a crowded day too, make sure to go upstairs, sit on one of the small side pavements and just observe the crowd. It is amazingly peaceful watching all these people that visit the temple for peace, health and happiness.

Whenever I see wood-carving works here in Nepal, I do very much appreciate the effort and time that the craft man put in to create such details. This is a fine example for such excellent work.

I was excited as I was told the statue in the temple resembled to real Gautam Buddha. A holy manuscript is read everyday which had special power. And many other things which made my expectations sky high for the place. As I visited the area, the road construction was a night mare. There were no guided alternate roads so we had to literally walk muddy narrow passage. The temple area was small and clean. Well maintained. But I couldn't find depth in anything. So much I wanted to learn but not by reading or listening but by experiencing. I felt, everything I read and told were just passed as tales and nothing more. It was early morning and I could see devotees - male and females flocking the temple. Is it a good idea to throw rice grains and metal coins on century old monuments? For me, the place is overrated. It was wise of old kings to build such mater piece but could not see enough effort to at least showcase it properly today."

It was an excellent place to stay! Shilandra and his family were extremely hospitable. As a solo traveler, I felt like part of the family and very comfortable at the Tajaa Pha. My laundry was promptly returned every week, and a great breakfast was always available if I did not feel like cooking that day. The home is centrally located to Patan - close to Patan Durbar Square, many other Newari heritage sites, and only a short taxi ride away from central Kathmandu. This is a must stay location if you are in Patan or want to escape hectic Thamel. The view from the top floor is great; it provides the best view of Patan and the mountains on a clear day."

We were surprised it wasn't in any of the guide books we saw (rough guide / lonely planet) as it is probably the best place we visited for a taste of local Newari food.  The location is behind a main road (about 10-15 mins walk from Patan Durbar square) and quite lovely, with a lot of the noise and dust of Kathmandu seemingly cut out, and the atmosphere is laid back and non-rushed. The restaurant was founded by a group who encourage and support employment of local women to work and earn money, where they otherwise would not be able to. The staff were very attentive and happy to explain all aspects of the local food and dishes they offered. While we are not experts we had tried other examples of Newari food and this was definitely the best we tried; it was obvious that the dishes were made with care and love.  Thumbs up."

But it was a bunch of friends, and I was swept away in the tides of peer pressure.  Surely, I thought, now they've taken the last year to tighten up their service so food comes out at the same time -- or that food comes out, period! Surely, their waiters will be more present. Surely, their bar service will be more on point.  Oh well.  It was a Saturday night, moderately busy, but plenty of waitstaff in front of house. Got seated promptly with menus, but that was the last I saw of anything resembling decent service.  I got excited about wine list. No one came to take an order, so after 15 minutes or so, I walked around the dining room until I could coax a waiter over to the table. I ordered some wine and food.  Twenty minutes later, no drinks yet. Used the bathroom. A stark contrast to the elegant open air dining room, the WC had all the ambience of a truck stop.  Another 10 minutes pass. A waiter comes to tell me (a different waiter, every time) about how they don't have that wine. Or that other wine I wanted. Or the other one. I ask him to tell me about the wines they *do* have. A few high end imports, well beyond what I originally intended to spend. Order their lackluster house wine instead (the one my corner bodega sells for 1/4 of the price). At least they had that. No one else at this point had received drinks either, not even water.  At last, my food arrived. All of it at once, app and main. One full hour later (seriously) my friend's food arrives. Some late joiners received their food much later still.  As for the quality of the food, I just don't get it, people! I mean, yes, we live in Kathmandu, not NYC or Paris or Singapore. I do get that. Managed expectations and all that. But the wings were non-offensive at best, and the pizza? Meh. The thin crust was soggy and bland, the ingredients tasted previously frozen. There is better pizza to be had in this town, three minutes walking to Roadhouse, to be specific. Not sure why so many reviewers are backflipping about Vesper food.  The final spectacle: separate checks. Holy cow. You'd think we'd asked for their firstborn child. So much resentment. But c'mon, people come to your restaurant precisely because you can support medium to large parties. Why you hating?  That's fine. I won't return anywhere I'm not wanted. At least not for another year."

As soon as we walked in we were seated in the courtyard and given a menu to order food and beverages. Coming from Australia things don't seem very as expensive here but when I dined in this restaurant my thoughts were changed. My mate and myself orders beers, chicken chilli and a pasta. To my surprise when our order was served I found no cheese topped on the pasta which was quite unusual and the chicken chilli served had more cheap veggies than chicken and was served cold. I asked the waiter if he could bring me some cheese to sprinkle on the pasta I had ordered. So he did (which I assumed would be a complimentary). But to my absolute surprise while going though the bill I discovered that I was charged NPR160+23%TAX for the parmesan cheese which was just a pinch in a small bowl, which I initially thought was complimentary. Pasta was NPR370+23%TAX & beer was NPR450+23%TAX. I wish I had retained the receipt with me so that I could upload on TripAdvisor. Also food here is very very very expensive and is not affordable by everyone. It is just meant for the people coming from overseas, people who make big bucks. I would highly suggest anyone thinking of going to this restaurant in the near future to reconsider your decision and plan elsewhere. One of the worst restaurant I have dined in Kathmandu."

All the Italian food and the seafood appetizer we ordered was very tasty and reasonably priced, although the fish and chips was just average.  The Vesper House is now serving the full restaurant menu after the old Cafe building was destroyed, and they have expanded the space to accommodate more people. It is a nice, modern, clean space with plenty of room, although i hope they add a ""play"" room for little ones like the old building had to make it more family friendly.  The service was very friendly and the staff accommodated us and the children. However, a staff member should return to the table after the food has been served to check, and also ask if we want our bill or dessert after the meal. Each time I've eaten at Vesper (both old and new) it's taken forever to ask for and get the bill.

Tonight I decided to try Vesper's and was thrilled to see Mulled Wine available as it was a cool evening. So I ordered a mulled wine, plain soda and a pepperoni pizza with mushrooms and a side of pesto. I was simply shocked to see ""pepperoni"" so I had to try it. I sat by a heater inside and read my book peacefully, sipping the mulled wine, which was overly fragrant (I tried to take a deep breath before I took a drink). I actually loved the flavor of the wine, but wasn't too keen on the spices floating in the wine, i.e. couldn't that be strained off prior to serving? The pizza arrived and I was famished so I inhaled 2 slices without even really taking a moment to make a decision on whether I actually liked it. And ultimately my conclusion was - meh. Something about it just didn't taste right. Maybe it's the cheese, maybe the sauce...crust was alright. But hey I've been living near NYC for nearly 13 years and before that Italy, so what was I expecting. If I went back - though I doubt I will in the next 10 days I'll be here - I'd probably give pasta or risotto a shot."

One of the best meals I've had in a long time. A bed of rice with an assortment of various kebabs and to top it all an entire leg of lamb so we'll marinated that meat was falling off the bone..

It was also a reunion of sorts as when living in Kathmandu ten years ago, we were regulars of Tasneem’s home catering, food perfect for house parties – wholesome deliciousness with homey flavours. Tasneem had since then gone on to open her restaurant and my husband and I were keen to see the place and, of course, to meet Tasneem and her family – it had been exactly ten years since we saw them last. Twelve of us were booked for lunch at TKK and to be honest, we were wondering how the restaurant would manage, expecting a Mom and Pop operation. However, on reaching TKK, we were charmed by the lovely and well run restaurant created by Tasneem and her husband, Harshawardhan.  We were also delighted to find that the food served was as wholesome as we remembered from years ago but the flavours had been upped to pack a restaurant dining experience punch. Right from the aam panna and the jal jeera drinks that we ordered to the starters and the main meal to dessert – every thing was fabulous! As we were 12 of us with different preferences, we made our choices there and then, ordering off the menu, so it can be safely said that everyone else in the restaurant, too, was having the same quality of food that we were served.  Of special mention are the scrumptious Bohra Chicken Cutlets (nothing comes close to the ones served at TKK – even in Bombay which is known for this cutlet) with the mince succulent and a light coating of egg cooked just right; the innovative vegetarian seekh kabab delivering an intense burst of flavour; the fragrant mutton biryani and the equally aromatic vegetable biryani with the delectable pineapple raita; the delicious kababs and tandoor items – vegetarian and non vegetarian – perfectly grilled, lightly crusted on the outside, juicy on the inside.  Saving the best for last is Tasneem’s signature Butter Chicken prepared in a unique way. Instead of the usual chunky tikkas of chicken, you are served pulled chicken (marinated and cooked slowly till tender enough to be pulled into strips) in a rich, creamy gravy. The resultant dish is a luscious blend with the gravy going deep into every bit of chicken unlike the usual dish made with chunks of meat with the gravy only coating the tikka. The Butter Chicken made in Tasneem’s style is also easy to have with the pulled chicken lending itself to being wrapped and eaten in any roti of your choice unlike the tikka style as larger chunks do not hold well in rotis like the thicker tandoori and paratha. While on rotis, there is an assortment of Indian breads, the garlic butter naan being a personal favourite, as is the velvety phirni we ordered for dessert.  It is easy to see that Tasneem has not compromised in any way on the high standards she set for herself when starting out and catering to smaller groups of people with her wholesome and appetizing home catering. For instance, her mutton kababs still have no tallow added, something many commercial establishments resort to, to increase volume and quantity. The change: from catering from her home, her setting is now TKK – a warm and inviting place – where she and her husband make you feel at home, providing exceptional Indian food with the young and enthusiastic wait staff providing excellent service. Tasneem’s home catering set a benchmark in Kathmandu. Her restaurant sets it once again. Will be back for the Nihari and Kabsa. Good luck and best wishes."

Tasneem, the ever present host, is always there greeting at the door, stepping through the dishes to suit your mood and always ready to give recommendations.  Indian food in Kathmandu has oddly never been a strength for this city despite its proximity. Tasneem's Kings Kitchen is one of those locations where the food is an absolute labour of love, hard to find spices are imported by Tasneem and she puts them to excellent use.  Last night I was invited to a traditional Bora meal (8 people required), I didn't know much going into it. What awaited was multiple courses ranging from custard to carrot pudding to amazing mutton slow cooked over 14 hours. It was an absolute delight, our entire group savored each and every mouthful. (Let her know in advance that you want the Thaal Bohra feast)  There has been some recent additions to the restaurant providing covering over their bar and reception area, beautiful lighting and a wonderful courtyard. My special recommendations, go for biryani, butter chicken, naan and some chicken Multani Wings. Actually, try everything on the menu at least once, beautiful tasty food awaits. Tasneem puts everything into every dish, so, if you're looking for authentic family style dishes then look no further."

Well appointed solar panels that do not jar the sights also contribute towards the power requirements of the restaurant. All of this is discretely set in a very natural environment. A place where you would like to relax and enjoy your food.  Then to the food itself. Had 6 starters cannot decide which one should get a special mention. All had it's unique flavours and authenticity, a welcome change from restaurants that have a common base for all foods. Most of the starters had the ""Bohra"" touch. For those not in the know the ""Bohra's"" are a small community in India that is know for it's unique dishes that tickle every palate and want in you. The serving that night certainly stirred my want to come back to the restaurant again and I was still on my starters. The of course was the main course, difficult to beat the starters was my initial thought and kept my expectations not that high.

You may taste the spices and the different flavours, but according to me they serve their heart on the plate.  The butter chicken is delectable and so tender and spiced so perfect it is like perfect balance of mother's love and traditional cooking skills.

We certainly were not disappointed when we visited Tasneem's Kings Kitchen.  Firstly we visited on 31 October 2016 which is Diwali, an important holiday in Nepal. In spite of that the service was first class and we never had to wait when ordering food or drinks. In fact our waiter was very attentive throughout the whole evening even though the restaurant was busy.  Secondly, our waiter was very helpful when it came to helping us with food and drink suggestions, pointing out what he thought we would like and special deals on the local beer.  Third, the food itself was delicious. Tasneem (the owner, who is clearly very hands on when it comes to her restaurant) went out of her way to recommend dishes that we might not otherwise have chosen, explaining the different flavours. The hospitality from her and her husband really made our evening and made a memorable meal into one that became the highlight of our time in Nepal. She is clearly a passionate foodie and even gave us some of her chocolates to sample which are also on sale (and delicious!).  All in all this was our favourite meal in Nepal. When we come back we will definitely visit and would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant with its fantastic food and friendly atmosphere to others.  Thank you Tasneem, we will be back!"

From the minute I created the event to when we were walking out of the door at the end of the evening, Tasneem and her staff were kind, accommodating, and professional. We had over 25 people come for the dinner club and Tasneem arranged two different spaces in her restaurant to accommodate our large group--one outside in the beautiful garden space, and another in the upstairs level of the restaurant in the case of rain. When I arrived at her restaurant, she promptly greeted me and gave me a tour of the space, and was present throughout the evening to make food recommendations and ensure that everyone was happy. And that doesn't even begin to describe the food, which is the best Indian food I have ever eaten. Tasneem has been in the food industry for over 10 years, and her experience shows. I only have a few weeks left in Kathmandu, but I am going to make returning to Tasneem's one of my priorities. It's affordable and simply delicious.

I get the impression that our dishes were not as spicy as they normally make them as we had two small children with us and we asked them to keep it spiced for the kids. My husband had gone with a friend on a different occasion and he said that the food was much spicier (and delicious!).  But the food was only the half of it. The owner is so kind and engaging. Made us feel so welcome. Our waiter made recommendations on how much to order (perfect amount!), the food came out fast but without making us feel hurried.

Update: this is still one of my favorite restaurants anywhere! Nothing beats their warm hospitality--or the luscious biryanis.  The succulent chicken tandoori drumsticks remain one of my favorite appetizers--rich with spices, tender, nothing like the dry red bones you find elsewhere. A number of new apps have made it onto the menu, including sweetly spicy Kashmiri aloo (which I could eat every day) and delicate, savory batata wada. The chicken tikka momos are a smart invention, and I hope they inspire others in Kathmandu to step up their momo game.  New specials are always appearing on the menu, and I am a big fan of the mutton dishes (the kaddhai ghosht!) sopped up with garlic or butter naan. But don't make my classic blunder and fill up on gravies before the biryani arrives. The chicken seekh biryani really will be the highlight of your evening..."

The nice thing about the atmosphere is its location in a quiet dead end parking area. Expect a more student, casual atmosphere. Not a place a to sit down to do work but more to hang with friends. Some of the decor is quite funky, i do like it, albeit its maybe too 'busy' with all the posters and leaflets.  As it was our first time, we were totally confused what to do. The person didn't communicate very well when i asked what to do. Apparently you order the coffee and pick it up yourself, paying later but there are no prices...you pay what you think its worth. However any sweet snacks have to be paid up front. This is all good when someone explains it, otherwise you are left feeling awkward.

Have been going to this place for the last 15 years. However, their signature pizzas are now half cooked, may be because the orders are rushed. They put no seasoning ( the pizzas are flavourless) on the pizzas, every other bite you have use your imagination to use the mix of oregano, tabasco, chili flakes, olive oil to make every bite worth the pain of visiting and waiting for a good meal that you pay to feel good. The food after 20-25 mins of normal wait comes at a lukewarm temperature. Is it because most ingredients are precooked and reheated? Take your guess. What about the crust? Is it celebratory chef tradition to give the dough half baked? It’s not about the warm lights, and eco construction and the disillusioned management. It’s about the food. Its disappointing. Wood fired pizzas are/were not uncommon but roadhouse pizzas stood out because of their consistency and good value. Now it’s on a decline. If the food doesn’t make sense, the charades don’t matter. Moksha has better pizzas than roadhouse, but they are not that great too. Please don’t order their starters, potato skin and their nachos might give you jitters about that late night indigestion and chest burn and if the pizzas could save your visit, you are in for a disappointment, again. Please don’t make a mistake of ordering from Foodmandu either, making a simple grilled cheese sandwich at home is more worthwhile."

I arrived on a Sunday evening (I was staying at the Piano B&B above the restaurant). I walked in and instantly knew this was somewhere I could trust. I told the owner, Antonio that I was too tired to think and to just choose what he thought I should eat. There are very few restaurants I would be happy to have choose the food for me, Piano B is one of them. The food is absolutely delicious! I mean every single thing they make is delicious, from the fresh bread, olive oil and balsamic to nibble on while you order, to the cheese and meat plater to the perfectly al dente pasta dishes to the high quality wine they store.  Antonio has established an amazing little restaurant and to anyone in Kathmandu who has heard of Piano B but never visited, you really need to go there. This guy is working his butt off to deliver quality and having spent 7 weeks in Kathmandu this summer, I have seen the time and effort he is putting into his place.  Having stayed at the B&B above I had the pleasure of eating many many times at this restaurant, its hard to find food this good in my current city of Boston, never mind Kathmandu. And if you're reading this thinking, ""Italian food? In Nepal? Why?"" then you've the same thought my colleagues had when they travelled to Nepal for 4 days last week towards the end of my trip. After I took them there, one commented in the morning that he dreamt of the Spinach Ravioli and despite the two thinking I was crazy to take them to an Italian on their four day visit to Nepal, they insisted we go back the very next night, and were again served with the same amazing food.  Like the B&B the restaurant is well managed, the staff are polite and professional, the ambience is tasteful as is the music. They stock real beer, real wine, real COFFEE, and trust me all of it meets the highest of standards of a classy Italian restaurant. I would say this is the best restaurant in all of Kathmandu and probably Nepal, yes its not traditional Nepali food, but quality is quality!  So just go there! And get the little onion dish starter thing. Oh and the chocolate lava cake. And an espresso to finish. And drink their house white.  I'm coming back!"

It was good to walk into this buzzy little place on a Friday night and the food was indeed good but the big disappointment is that for a wine bar/restaurant with a reputedly serious attitude to wine, the wait staff have no basic training in understanding wine. When I enquired what grape variety an unfamiliar wine on the list was, I was told it was ""dry."" When I repeated my enquiry about which grape it had been made from, I was told ""No grapes - dry."" What a shame in an otherwise commendable place. Disappointing also was the lack of contact from the (presumably) owner manager. I tried two or three times to make eye contact to exchange pleasantries with no success. After reading the reviews, I had assumed (bad idea) that he would understand the importance of relationship-building and hosting in the hospitality industry. The ambience was very pleasant and there is an excellent list of imported food and wine items which must be a real achievement in Nepal. The Friday night buzz was high but personally too noisy for a mature age quiet enjoyment. An excellent wine bar, but as a passionate wine love, please educate the staff."

The oil is of good quality and they make a fresh gelato (ice cream) as well as good tiramisu. The restaurant is run with passion, and the idea is one of reproducing Italian food as much as possible. Here, luckily, you would not find things like ""spaghetti bolognese"" that ARE NOT ITALIAN and are honestly disgusting, but tagliatelle with rabbit sauce, or freshly made pesto, or spaghetti with bottarga. THIS Is Italian. They are using real olive oil, and also real Italian cocktails, like ""spritz"" are available. PIano B is highly, higly recommended."

But for Kathmandu, it's the closest you'll get.  I've been in several times now, as it's the one dependably good restaurant in my immediate neighborhood. Even beyond my immediate neighborhood, I can't think of any place better. The food is pretty darned authentic, the wine selection is nothing to sneeze at, the service is... well, the service is on par or slightly better than you would expect for this corner of the world.  I suppose it's the little details. For example, if a place is out of a wine that's listed on the menu, the waiter might suggest something similar, rather than shrugging his shoulders and saying, ""Finished.""  But again, we're not in NYC or Sicily. We are here.  I've been in on my own, I've also arrived unannounced with a clutch of friends. Every time, the wait staff and kitchen make it happen, and despite my OCD complaints (worked in service industry for 10 years, so I notice things), Piano B is solid as they come out here.

We spend good time even though It's painful to see the animals in cage ,but it's the only chance to see animals are housed within enclosures, cared for, displayed to the public, and in some cases bred Modern zoos also aim to help teach visitors the importance on animal conservation, often through letting visitors witness the animals firsthand. Some critics and the majority of animal rights activists say that zoos, no matter what their intentions are, or how noble they are, are immoral and serve as nothing but to fulfill human leisure at the expense of the animals (which is an opinion that has spread over the years). However, zoo advocates argue that their efforts make a difference in wildlife conservation and education. Many zoos work to improve their animal enclosures and make it fit the animals' needs, although constraints such as size and expense make it difficult to create ideal captive environments for many species. Animals in zoos often exhibit behaviors that are abnormal in their frequency, intensity, or would not normally be part of their behavioural repertoire. These are usually indicative of stress. For example, elephants sometimes perform head-bobbing, bears sometimes pace repeatedly around the limits of their enclosure, wild cats sometimes groom themselves obsessively, and birds pluck out their own feathers. Some critics of zoos claim that the animals are always under physical and mental stress, regardless of the quality of care towards the animals."

This zoo was establish more than 100yr old is by Rana primeminister. At that time it was one of the best and lovely place to visit for the animals of Nepal. In the courses of time it could not be modified only very little changes are done to accommodate more animals. Instead of more animals in the zoo we found less animals but more people due to the growth of population and there is no place for children to take. People come here to see people instead animals. Unfortunately one of the beautiful historic zoo of Kathamandu turned ugly zoo.

We made a big mistake, the animals are few, unhealthy and in prisons - my son did not reognise anything. we were also told there was a child friendly environment, again we were shocked as it was some dirty shutes and no grass, food, shade, or anywhere for him to play. most annoying was the fact that I am British and my wife Nepai - my son is Nepali, and for the elephant ride they wanted to make him - 22 months old - pay fives more than Nepali children, he is Nepali! so the fee for Nepalis is good for the bad environment, charging me four times more as a 'foreigner' is annoying but ok, but asking my Nepali son to pay adult white foreign price is insulting and racist as he just - by accident - looks like his father and not his mother - we are not tourists as live here, pay tax, and work - so not only is it a good example of the cruelty animals suffer here, but a good example how people are exploited and everything is about money here"

Some of the animals do look sad - the cages aren't big, and the vegetation is dry and dusty. Some of the animals show obvious signs of stress, such as the bears that walked back and forth. That said, the employees take obvious pride in keeping it free of litter and looking after the animals as best they can. Signs are in both English and Nepali (although the maps showing where the animals are from doesn't always match the English, e.g. maps of Africa although the text says an animal is from the Himalayas).  The highlight for us was the tiger feeding, which (between 11-12am) lets you feed the tigers in person for NRS200/person. It's not for the squeamish (you're feeding them great big bits of raw water buffalo) or scared (they really want the food and make a lot of noise telling you this, and you are very close), but it's amazing! All up we spent 2 hours at the zoo (including time waiting for the tiger feeding and doing this). Opens 10-5 (not 9-5 as says elsewhere).  At the moment (Jan 2016) they are doing some construction work, building new pens and enclosures, but it didn't seem to affect our ability to see any of the animals."

Whilst the conditions for the animals are far from ideal the only way things will improve here will require more foreign visitors to visit. I say foreign visitors because locals only pay 50 rupees to visit but foreign visitors pay 500 rupees. There were a few children's groups here on the day we visited and they were having a great time. If you have nothing to compare this zoo to, you would think it to be ok. Being spoilt with living in Sydney and having a wonderful zoo like Taronga within a few kilometres it was sad to compare the conditions the animals at Nepal Central Zoo are kept in. So I am torn in my review, It's a sad zoo but by not going will just make things worse."

However, with my GCSE, A-level and Bachelor's degree knowledge in Biology I was saddened to see most of the animal enclosures. I saw turtles in enclosures with no water, a bird with a broken leg, jackalts in a concrete enclosure, and almost none of the enclosures we're suited to the wild habitat of the animal- for example the majority of the bird enclosures were filled with weeds. I witnessed a group of people teasing and aggravating the leopards, with no keepers present throughout our visit to keep and eye on animal health or incidents with visitors. The fishing lake is over-grown with algae, which is known to shade and kill submerged plants, which then decompose and use up the oxygen in the water which the fish and other organisms need. The grounds were well-kept, and there we're a couple of rides and a park for children. Entry price was good value (500 rupees for foreigners) Overall, I think the enclosures require attention for the welfare of the animals, but I was pleased to see an animal hospital and I would probably not go again accept to raise money to improve animal welfare."

This is a decent excursion for kids to see the animals and you are not nearly as far away from the animals as you would be at most western Zoos. There is a nice pond that you can go paddle boating on, which incidentally is the same pond they bathe the resident elephant in, something that kids really seem to enjoy seeing from the boats. Manage your expectations and you will likely be pleasantly surprised.  Tip: across the street from the Zoo there's a nice little local momo place. Cheap and delicious."

But overall, a descent variety of animals, and caters to locals and families well. The elephant ride I was looking forward too, but due to medical issues, it wasn't providing rides. He was roaming with his trainer around the grounds and you could get great close up pictures with him which was nice. Tigers were the highlight, as were the monkeys for me. Two beautiful Bengals, looking very happy and healthy took the attention of most crowds. Though the zoo is dated by modern standards as far as being clean, and size of enclosures, it is a very nice zoo that seems to be doing the best it can with its resources and those efforts should be commended. Anyone saying it's too expensive for a foreigner, at $5 US to get in should be ashamed, considering the prices I've paid to get into zoos in Europe and the US. I wish the locals would respect their national treasures as much as they should, as water bottles and trash were thrown throughout, and though the guards do random checks of people's bags to assure no plastic bags get in, maybe the same rules should apply to water bottles if people can dispose of them correctly. The views of many animals allows you to get much closer than most zoos, and as I said, the Nepalese have done a good job overall considering their resources."

Great religious history,"You have to go to Patan Durbar square. My advice would be if you are staying in Patan, go to see it as soon as possible. There is no need to pay for a guide (but do if you like) because all of the information is provided in books or online.  A lot of museum is about the reconstruction of it after the earthquake. But it is great to see such beautiful structures.  The square also has loads of market/shop stalls with people selling loads of stuff. Haggle and negotiate, but not too much because the prices are already quite reasonable. Beware, most of the “North face” jackets are fake, still very warm and decent quality but not good if you’re gonna go mountaineering!  Just a short walk from Durbar square is the Kumari living goddess of Patan. Go and visit her and receive Tika."

Our guide spent a lot of time telling us about the reconstruction, and it appears that it is going well and will look as it did before the earthquake when finished. Almost every building is propped up with huge boards to stabilize them, and large cracks are seen everywhere.  There are still plenty of beautiful carvings to see on the buildings and carved stone figures and statues throughout. We went to visit the house of the Kumari Devi (the Living Goddess). We could not go in but were allowed in the courtyard to see if she would make an appearance at a window. No photos allowed if she appeared. She did appear and looked out at everyone. This goddess is a 5 year old girl who lives apart from her family until she reaches puberty. It was quite an interesting story.  Worth a visit even though some people complained about the entrance fee. The entrance fee is worth it if this trip is something that you will probably never do again, so why not?"

I didn't enter Kathmandu Durbar Square cause of the expensive entrance fee but it seemed in complete disarray and didn't think there would be much to see.  The Patan Durbar Square also has a lot of rehabilitation going on but it's not as tight and stressful to get into as the Kathmandu one. There's a lot more space to move around and most of the main building has been preserved.  A huge plus about going to Patan Durbar Square is that it houses the Patan Museum, which is easily the best museum I've been to in Nepal. It was very informative and described facts about Hindi and Buddhist history, iconography, symbolisms, and belief systems. I really appreciated that. Because of this, you wouldn't need a tour guide anymore.  Some groups got a tour guide and they sometimes spoke loudly to be heard. Because of that, I would get some interesting new information at random and that was a nice little surprise.  I highly recommend going to this place!"

Unprepared for what was going on back then,we were in shock and the image of them pulling the next buffalo up to be beheaded(while the poor buffalo clearly shivering and hesitated to walk ahead) more or less kill the mood for the rest of the day. We were out of that temple right after seconds comprehending what was going on,very upset.  We respect the local culture and religious belief but just for the experience: if you don't want to see unexpected slaughter,as soon as you see animals (buffaloes , goats,etc at their unusual residence) +some kind of rituals going on+a crowd around it,don't look and walk away,we are sure there are lot of other ways to experience Nepal than witnessing some animals slaughtered."

Across the road from the pay station there is a raised terrace that affords you a great view of the complex. As I said most of the area is intact but the Hari Shankar Mandir has gone, the Yoganarendra Malla Pillar is up, but behind scaffoldng, the Jagan Narayan Mandir is gone, the Krishna Mandir is heavily scaffolded but they let you in, and the Manimandapa Mandir(?) is gone. That said it is a cool spot to visit and much less ""commercial"" than Kathmandu. The Patan Museum is definitely worth visiting - lots of nice historical exhibits. You also get to walk round the Royal Palace."

The is the perfect time to visit Kathmandu and the nearby, world heritage site of the old city centre of Patan's, Durbar Square. A trip there is now especially gratifying, as the local economy is heavily dependent on tourism, which has significantly fallen from pre-earthquake days. From Kathmandu, it is an easy, thirty minute taxi ride to this living museum. While there is evidence of earthquake damage, most of the splendid buildings remain intact. There is a palpable vibrancy and optimism that adds to the energy of the place. Walking amidst the magnificently carved ancient wooden temples is a powerful experience. The very impressive Patan Museum in the historic town centre is not be missed. (And the delicious veggie momos in the museum's terrace café make for a splendid break!)"

The square also houses the Patan Museum, which is simply amazing. It is easy to walk from here to the nearby Mahabuddha temple.

You still have to pay to get into the area of the Square - but all the sourrounding streets are far more welcoming and you are treated as less of a target for touts etc etc in this square.  A relativeley small area the square is a rectangular shaped area bordered on one side by the old Palace and on the other side of a wide thoroughfare are a variety of temples. The locals transit through the square and it does have a genuine local feel to it.  Unlike Kathmandu this square is blocked off for cars and mopeds, and it does look like they have spent some of the entrance fee on improving the infrastructure.  Concidering the short distance from the centre of Khatmandu I would thoroughly reccomend a trip here - it's a far better Durbar Sq (Although not quite as good as Bhaktapurs)."

The reason to get a guide is to ensure you find the Buddhist Golden Temple which is hidden down some side streets from the primarily Hindu buildings. 500 Rupees for entry fee. The architecture is very cool and about 500 years old. The Golden Temple is worth the extra 50 Rupees entrance fee. Gold-plated and from the 12th century. Be ready to say 'no' to being taken to more shops as that is common with these guides who receive a kickback."

Westerners pay a higher entry ticket price (roughly 1000Rs), but the day-ticket can be extended for several days until the end date of your visa if you bring it to show at the ticket counter. This square seems to be the center of business as well, so taxis from here are easy to find. Don't miss the museum and the Museum Cafe! You may be approached for tours of the area that usually start at 1200Rs, but negotiate hard. Some tour guides will take you to Tibetan shops to sell you singing bowls and paintings--all beautiful and whatnot, but steeply overpriced. Be sure to negotiate very low for these if you do want to purchase. Otherwise, don't cave in to pressure or let your guide know you aren't willing to buy before entering."

He also contrived to take us to two workshops....and fascinating though they both were, there was some pressure to buy. So, if you are with your Nepal tour guide you should be ok but otherwise be firm with local guides about where you want to go and what you want to discover.

Founded in the 3rd century, Patan is also called Lalitpur or 'Beautiful City'. According to my guidebook, there are 55 major temples in this city alone and 136 courtyards many of which make this beautiful section of the city a photographer's paradise.  We strolled through this marvelous square and spent about three hours enjoying the sights, sounds, smells, and colors of this magnificent World Heritage site. We started with the Royal Palace to our right and moved on to the Sacred Well just beyond. The water that comes out of the spouts comes from a water source miles away. There is the pillar surmounted by a gilt statue of King Yoganarendra Malla shaded by the hooded cobra that hovers over him and the simply splendid Krishna Mandir with its colonnades and porches and a huge dome over all.  I really wish I had the time to come back here because there is so much to see that I probably overlooked a lot. On the day of our visit, the square was very crowded because there was an election rally with thousands of people waving flags and listening to the speakers. There were pilgrims and monks visiting the religious sites and temples, shoppers bustling about, and tourists dining at cafes and restaurants. The place has an energy level that can't be beat.  We also moved on to the Golden Temple in the north part of town. Again, very exciting. See my photos as these are worth a thousand words. Note that there is a small fee to enter this area of the city. Pay it without complaint as it helps to preserve this marvelous complex."

There are clothes attached to the roofs of the castles which dances as the wind blows which gives a feeling of peace. There are plenty of food stalls around. The day we were there hosted a public performance on interactive theater by this local group. I would recommend people to visit this place if they have the opportunity to.  Oh and there are admission fees to enter this facility. The rate however is different for the natives, South Asian citizens and others.

It is an amazing collection of Buddhist and Hindu buildings. Patan / Lalitpur is 15 minutes drive from Kathmandu south across the Bagmati River. Its a wonderful place to wander for a couple of hours, with no cars in your way. There is a ticket kiosk at the entrance to the square, it costs 500rs and you have to wear a sticker. Around the entrance there are pushy people wanting to be your guide, even small children are in on the act. One said to me ""sooner or later you will have to give in"". You don't need a guide, I found them so persistent I headed straight for a rooftop café called Café du Temple and just sat there reading about the square and viewing it from afar. The square can be very relaxing if you find your own secluded spot. Children play badmington, people wash their clothes in a nearby well. Make sure you set aside a couple of hours for the museum. Look out for some Bull's instestines hanging over a door near the museum."

Make sure you keep your ticket with you, staff are around checking and if you can't show it you will be taken to the ticket booth. Take time to wander through the side streets and see a little more of Patan, there are some great value little craft shops. We had some wooden gifts made to bring home for a really reasonable price and watching the craftsmen work on them made them extra special. Great for people watching and watching life go by."

This Durbar Square is, however, in Patan which, at one time, would have been separate from old Kathmandu. Kathmandu has extended so much it has now swallowed areas that might have, historically, been townships in their own right.  Patan Durbar Square has more impressive temples and historic sights than its counterpart in Kathmandu. Don't visit Nepal without seeing both, however, as each has something to offer.  A pleasant thing about Durbar Square is that one isn't hassled, or at least not too much, by persons offering to act as a guide, sell one souvenirs, etc. Be sure to bargain with taxi drivers, as they will almost inevitably try and overcharge you. The same applies to shops and stalls selling handicrafts, Pashmina shawls and souvenirs. One can end up paying very considerably less than what the seller initially demands. A good time to buy is nearing the end of the day. Traders find it hard to avoid the temptation to make one last sale and some real bargains can be obtained in these circumstances."

The temple at the square is very old and the carvings are erotic. Have a good look. Vendors and shopkeepers do not overcharge if you can bargain. I find it bad that western tourists have to pay to visit this place when anybody else can walk in and out. School kids are everywhere, one cannot take a decent picture of a monument or statue without some kids sitting on it. This was the same in Bahktapur where I had regretted that I had paid 10 euro when I saw that so many walked in without paying. A visit to the museum still has to be paid extra anyway. In Patan, they try to avoid that people walk in without paying (only if you look western, speaking of discrimination) by obliging you to hang the large ticket around your neck. Just awful. It spoiled my appreciation of this wonderful old place, having this thing around my neck. I felt like an animal for sale. Why not make the entrance free for all without discrimination and charge for separate visits of the temple, the museum, etc... Tourists are more than just milk cows that are only good for their money."

There is a museum inside the square and many shopping complexes as well.  In Nepal there are so many religious festivals and one the day that my husband and I visited this place, there was a festival. They played religious music and the women were dressed in red. It will be great if you can visit on a day of a festival as the place is very colourful on such days.  The history of the place is displayed and you can take time to read it and I suggest that you do that because then you get the real feel of what the square was and what it means to the Nepali people. The Hindus believe in Gods and Goddesses in the modern context as well. A young girl who is referred to as 'kumari' that translates as 'princess' stays in the palace in Durbar Sqaure and it is believed that she is a reincarnation of 'Kali'. You will not get an opportunity to see this princess. However, there are so many little temples all over in the square and it is worth a visit."

Although the square is relatively small, the buildings are intact and so rich in detail as to keep you busy - especially if you're a photographer - for hours.  Roughly speaking, on one side are the royal palace buildings, and on the other side are the various temples, including one in South Indian or 'shikara' style, built of stone and dedicated to the god Krishna. The other wooden temples are in Nepalese architecture, some with erotic carvings on the roof struts. There are also a couple of metal statues on poles in the square, and plenty of details on the buildings to keep the visitor absorbed.  Various architectural styles are presented, with fascinating stories of various features. Pay for a local guide - it's well worth it, as much of the richness of the site is not apparent otherwise.

What I’d come to this place for is the desserts, muffins, and drinks. The banana chocolate chunk muffins are pretty damn fantastic. The brownies had a gooey crystallized sugar that for once among the brownies I tasted in Nepal – tasted like a brownie, not some mild chocolate dry cake. But the almond cookies are really what blew me away. I’m Sicilian and my grandmother and mother make cookies like these at the holidays. You only need one; it will fulfill the craving. And upon reading another review I opted to try the thick milkshake though it was cold outside – it was thick and yummy. Now to just expand the milkshake options: cookies and cream, chocolate peanut butter, frozen monkey (coffee, chocolate and banana). And to really make this place stand out…board games…they should have board games and a few heaters! No one would ever leave!!!

I feel like Cafe Soma should do outreach to other restaurants in Asia to teach them how to make a real milkshake instead of serving flavored lassi's.

As I live in Kathmandu as an expat, I can say the food and service are consistently very good and it is good value for money. The dish I order most often is the Thali - they call it something different on the menu but ask the waiter or look for the description of various small dishes (cured vegetables, pickle, paneer cheese and rice) served on a platter - vegetarian or meat options available. It is delicious and presentation is super. If you are interested in trying something totally unique drink wise, ask them to demonstrate the pouring of the local Aeyla. The better quality ones Yala serves are actually very smooth to drink - the cheap stuff in other local bars tastes as if it could clean limescale off water pipes. The biggest problem is to find the place. There are no street names and local people don't know it or send you to a different place so here is my recommendation for a wonderful afternoon in Patan which culminates at Yala for dinner! First, visit Patan Durbar Square, a world heritage site of ancient temples and King's palaces. Do stroll around the nearby market - spices, metal items and flowers for temple offerings. After that, use GPS or your tour guide/ local person to get you to the Golden Temple. This is a fantastic temple to visit - one I take all visitors to - it doesn't disappoint. A guide is useful as there is so much crammed into the small courtyard and you could miss and/or misunderstand much of the symbolism. Afterwards, as you exit Golden Temple turn right, stay on this street - and it's a 2 minute walk to Yala. It will be on your left side and there is a freestanding temple structure almost outside it. The sign is easy to miss -- keep a keen eye for the word Yala! Spend your evening enjoying the great food, outdoor candelit dining available, and friendly service. The staff will point you in the direction of the best place to get a taxi. It's easy to get a taxi ""from"" here but not ""to"" here."

If you’ve never had an Ayurvedic oil bath, you have not fully lived! This exceptional treatment, which is their end-of-panchakarma ritual, is unlike anything I have ever experienced, and I am still walking on air, enjoying a lightness of body, mind and spirit that was my intention and desire when I initially booked the program.  I simply cannot say enough good things about Moksha. A few years ago I’d had a panchakarma elsewhere, but it was not a residential program and this time around I wanted a place to stay where I could fully immerse myself in the experience… and Moksha exceeded all expectations. The first and final word to describe my experience here is “nurturing”. Because Moksha is a small, intimate place (currently only 2 rooms for residential programs although they have plans to expand just slightly to 4 rooms, and many people just come in for day treatments) you are nurtured on every possible level… body, mind, emotion and spirit… and this is the true purpose of a panchakarma, to connect with, purify and heal every aspect of your being.  In retrospect, I really wish I had made more time to do a longer course of treatment, as 7 days really just begins to graze the surface. Regardless, Dr. Padma did a beautiful job of discerning through our consultation what my primary goals and concerns were and addressing them during my week.  The treatments themselves were incredible. They have a staff of practitioners whose caring hearts and hands make sure you are being maximally nurtured during each massage (so many different types!) scrub, cleansing process, chakra healing etc. Even the necessary but more unpleasant treatments were done with ultimate care and there was nothing that felt routine about any of it. Each moment felt as if it was being done and given to me for my specific needs and particular specifications. I felt deeply cared for.  And then there was Sanjay. Each morning I had two hours of personalized yoga and pranayama as well as some beautiful discussion time about philosophy (yoga and life) and as a yoga instructor back home, this was particularly impactful for me. He is an incredible teacher with a wealth of knowledge, but perhaps more importantly, his energy is as warm and pure as it gets. My time with him in conjunction with the cleansing and purifying treatments themselves was exactly what I needed at that moment in time, as I had just come to the center after a particularly impactful spiritual journey and needed the appropriate space and support to help me integrate the experience.  The food… what can I say. It is authentic Ayurvedic food cooked with love, specifically for your needs to nurture you from the inside out. Delicious.  The center itself (treatment rooms, residence, reception, dining area etc) is impeccably clean and the rest of the support staff was also exceptional, helping in any way possible to make my stay more pleasant. On the morning of my departure Sanjay made sure I had food before my early morning flight and some extra apples for me to take on my journey… so sweet. The whole experience was incredibly personal and touching and I can’t remember ever being so attentively cared for in this way.  Leaving the center and in the days following, I feel so incredibly good. The Ayurvedic system of treating and caring for the entire human system… mind, body and spirit… is highly effective if done right. If you are thinking about doing a panchakarma or getting any sort of Ayurvedic care, it is well worth your while to come to Kathmandu and spend your time and money at Moksha, and after being there, I wouldn’t dream of getting Ayurvedic therapy anywhere else. There is absolutely no question that I will be back, and I look forward to it. Thank you Moksha team… you are all a real blessing."

I came in to treat my chronic back pain and nasal congestion, and I came out 10 days later with both of these illnesses cured as well as feeling completely relaxed and ready to conquer the world. Each day, they checked in with me about my progress and did everything they could to make me feel happy and relaxed. They treat you like family at Moksha. Dr Padma is a very kind, knowledgeable doctor and she answered all of my questions with ease and non judgment. The yoga and pranayama exercises in the morning with Sanjay worked very well with my treatments. The massage therapists gave the absolute BEST massages I've ever had. The food was extremely delicious, healthy, and made specifically for my dosha. The treatments I received were all hygienically prepared, using only fresh herbs. Dr Padma did an excellent job explaining all the procedures, describing my dosha, and giving me advice for the future. I highly recommend Moksha Ayurveda for anyone considering Panchakarma. Even if you come in for just a massage, you will not be disappointed. They offer many different packages to suit your needs. I will definitely be back once more before I leave Nepal."

Length: 10 days.  In short, Moksha are the best. The communication with Moksha via email while arranging your trip is quick, they send you an approximate program and price list per your request. They meet you at the Airport and bring you to the Center. You talk to Dr. Padma and she defines your body type and the treatment program. And the treatment starts. You live in a room right there in the villa. They make the meals on the spot. I was there in July, the “rainy” season with the cloudy sky and the daily temperature of 26 C. Not a bad time to come to Nepal. The Center is a villa with a garden, located in a quiet street of Lalitpur, a satellite city of Kathmandu. Taking into account the dirt, dust and terrible roads/streets of Kathmandu, this may be a plus. Lalitpur is cleaner than Kathmandu. The team are: Dr. Padma, Mr. Sanjay – yoga instructor and Ayurveda practitioner (he is such a cool guy), Nirajan – the manager and arranger of all things, Mr. Ram and two young men, Santosh and Milan – Ayurveda practitioners and masseurs. There are also several young ladies who do procedures to ladies. The cleanliness and hygienic norms at the Center are excellent. The procedure rooms, the procedures themselves, the oils, the towels, everything meets the highest hygienic standards. They take everything seriously: they are well equipped for the procedures and follow some strict rules. Ram, Santosh and Milan are excellent masseurs with strong hands who give the best oil massage. The massages they provide are very intense and tough but you can ask and regulate the intensity at any time. The massages are performed according to some principles which are beyond my competence: the hand movements along flows of energy in the body etc. The massage may last for two hours and even longer. They take it very seriously. In general, the whole team takes their work very seriously. If they do, they do it good. The procedures are lengthy, performed thoroughly, at a price much lower than probably anywhere in the world. The Center provides the comprehensive range of Ayurveda procedures (the list is available on their site). The basis is various oil massages plus daily yoga and pranayama classes. There are procedures such as synchronized 4-arm whole body oil massage and scrub with ginger and rice powder, or a massage with constantly flowing hot oil performed by six masseurs. Another procedure is Netra Tarpana: they pour oil on a patient’s open eyes. Although this may contradict the modern medicine, the improvement for my eyesight is obvious for me. Every morning you also take some minor procedures such as neti (nose cleansing). At the end of the treatment, they sell you some medicines to take home. Not much, not expensive. Minuses: First: the meals are a disaster. What is even worse is that the meals during the diet periods become scarce. You might have to request proper meals or go outside and eat properly on your own. Second: the rooms do not meet the criteria of comfort in the Western standards. One might consider living in some hotel nearby and coming to Moksha for procedures only."

They have a great variety of treatments, and the staff is extremely warm and welcoming. Sanjay always took time to check in with me before and after treatments to discuss my needs and progress.  The staff is skilled and knowledgeable, and provides dedicated service. I got a little bit of everything. The consultations were very thorough, and although I’m an Ayurvedic Practitioner in the U.S., I was able to learn a lot about myself from another point of view. My favorite therapies included the scrub, the facial, and the singing bowl treatment.  The staff was very accommodating, providing a few treatments specifically for me. I was congested, so they made me an herbal steam to inhale while I was getting massages. They also made me an herbal blend to use with a neti pot. It not only rid me of congestion, but also reduced the inflammation in my sinuses. I also was able to get a ghee treatment for the eyes. It was very refreshing and nourishing.  Since I was getting numerous treatments every day, I ate at the center. Both breakfast and lunch were absolutely delicious, and they gave me plenty of food. I highly recommend the gluten free pancakes for breakfast. Meals were served on the rooftop patio, where it was so quiet and peaceful.  After leaving the center and returning back home, I could still feel the subtle benefits of all the treatments. The doctor prescribed various herbal formulas for me to use while at home. For some symptoms, I noticed instant results. Others take more time, but I see them changing over time."

The team is competent, friendly and genuinely caring. Both of us have never experienced better massages. My boyfriend is in owe of Ram's skills, for example, but this knowledge applies to all other therapists too. The therapies and food are pure healing for the spirit, body and mind with very strong positive effects. They are both individualized, after a thorough consultation, and are adjusted based on the experience of the guest. The place itself is a small island of peace, perfect for contemplation, relaxation and internal silence. We enjoyed absolutely everything and would love to go back there as soon as possible.

There are three times offered for the class, which is very flexible, and we opted for 9am. At the start of the class we were offered the menu choices, and opted for chatamari, daal bhat and chocolate momo.  The location is great - the corner of an interesting complex in a quiet part of Patan, with a courtyard just outside where you can enjoy each dish as you cook it. We were staying in Patan and enjoyed the walk there, but 2Sisters also offers free pickup from Thamel.  The food we cooked with Shusma's help was super delicious! I was surprised at how quick and easy the chatamari was to cook. After eating lots of daal bhat during our travels, it was great learn how to make it ourselves, and the daal was sooo tasty and lovely and thick - no watery half-cooked version here! I didn't think we had room for chocolate momos but the high quality chocolate and ratio of pastry to chocolate to butter was perfect, we had no problems at all scoffing them down. :)  Shusma is a lovely host, we felt comfortable in an instant with her, and she is very kind and supportive. You really don't need to know 'how' to cook as she will guide you through the whole process. The time passed so quickly, just chatting away, making funny shaped momos and exchanging thoughts about our lives and travels. It was great to get more insight into Nepal from a local.  Shusma's kitchen is very clean, and all the ingredients are organic and high quality. There is purified water for drinking and preparing the ingredients, lots of soap and water for your hands, hand sanitiser, and aprons and hats for everyone cooking.  Finally, I need to mention the delicious masala tea we made and enjoyed at the start of the class. It was so warming, great on a chilly November morning. I am dreaming about that tea back home!  This is a great activity for anyone who loves food, whether you are an experienced cook or a complete beginner. All you need is a positive attitude and an empty stomach! Thank you Shusma for such a memorable experience."

Shusmas directions were easy to follow and the pace of the class allowed plenty of time to chat about the food, culture, politics... whatever you feel like. After each course we sat in the courtyard to enjoy our creations. There are a range of dishes you can choose to cook and a pickup from Thamel can be organised, although we enjoyed a nice walk from our accommodation near Patan Durbar Square (a good opportunity to check out a different neighbourhood, with some nice cafes around).

Shusma is a great teacher and goes through every step to make the perfect Nepali dishes. We even went to the local grocery shop to buy the ingredients before, where Shusma showed and explained to me the different vegetables and what they're used for. This gave me a real insight into Nepalese cooking. You are also given so much flexibility to choose the dishes you want to make (starter, main and desert). Finally a percentage of money she makes at the cookery classes goes into Women's empowerment- so definitely talk to Shusma about this as she gave me so much insight into the caste system, gender equality and what it means to be a women in Nepal."

So this place seemed nice from the outside hence we went in. Well i am still regretting why did we go in there ? Well when you go to a fine dinning restaurant especially Indian Cuisine there are a few expectations. They did not meet any of them. Starting with their veg menu did not have any spicy paneer item. That is still bearable. We ordered our food. In the mean while we were expecting papads which are usually given prior to your meal. We got them but we had to ask for the same. Then any indian restaurant does give you a main course plate with a side plate as well. The shocking thing was that their main plate was the size of the side plate and no side plate was provided. We ordered rotis as 3 plus 3 so that we get hot rotis but the service was so poor that we were left lingering for about 15 mins after the first round of rotis were finished. The food was average nothing great. Then when we asked for the cheque in any indian restaurant you do get a finger bowl or there are tissues on the table. No finger bowl was provided neither was any kind of mouth freshener .  The overall experience of dinning was extremely disappointing and would not go again or recommend any one unless they make drastic changes."

Here's the breakdown:  Brunch:  We were the only table. Coffee and juice came out relatively promptly. Waiter disappeared for the next 30-45 hour or so. My wife's food came out, then mine 10 minutes later. Her eggs and bacon were okay. The sausage gravy on my biscuits tasted a bit of mucous. Wouldn't order again.  Dinner:  We were one of 3 tables. Drinks came out quickly enough. Food came out in a timely manner as well, though the concept of a 'starter' was lost to the staff, as everything hit the table at once. The burger is probably the best I've had in Patan, but that's still not as good as the worst burger I've had in other countries. The wings were fried within an inch of their lives, so all you really taste is sauce around the wilted crispy skin that remains on the bone.  I would go to SC again in a pinch, especially if I were dying for a beef burger, but I'm in no hurry. I was disappointed, after reading so many favorable reviews about the place. You pay ""Western style"" prices but get very average results."

Southern Comfort’s menu is all American. Burgers, onion rings, Caesar salad, chicken-fried steak, biscuits and gravy. You get the idea. We ordered onion rings and a burger with chilies and cheese. The establishment’s owner stopped by and explained that to get a true American flavor he had to make many of the items we take for granted from scratch. He and his staff bake the hamburger buns, produce their own mayonnaise and home make the ranch dressing. The results are nothing short of spectacular for Nepal.  The onion rings were the first we’ve had during our two years in Nepal and the burger the best we’ve tasted in Kathmandu. Southern Comfort’s got all the American details just right. Our beer was even served ice cold in a frosty mug. Welcome home."

The second thing that came to mind was that we’ve probably been in Nepal too long when the first thing I notice is a clean tablecloth…  Looking up from the tablecloth and around Cibo’s tastefully decorated dining room, I leaned back, relaxed and enjoyed the pop music playing softly in the background. Our waiter arrived with the specials board, walked us through the options and retired to allow us to make our decisions. My wife settled on lamb cutlets, I on pepper steak (peppered steak would be more appropriate as it turns out). The wine arrived and finally (!) it was Friday.  On this Friday, we had Cibo to ourselves. Presently, we heard the mouthwatering sound of grilling meat from the open kitchen. A tempting aroma followed. On cue the waiter delivered a bowl of peanuts as a pre-dinner snack.  After a reasonable wait, our waiter returned with dinner. The presentation was among the best I’ve seen in Nepal. Grilled meat, arugula salad and roasted potatoes thoughtfully arranged and carefully presented. The taste lived up to the presentation. The steak, ordered medium, was cooked just so. The lamb was juicy and served with a pesto garnish.  As it turned out, Cibo was an excellent choice to end our week. The establishment’s refined décor, good service and better food made for a thoroughly enjoyable evening. Cibo is the complete package."

I preferred the dinner when I came a year and a half ago, with lots of variety and a ""chili fries"" dish that will blow your mind it's so good. The moms are great, too. Don't be surprised if the servers hand you a menu and have you point at what you want. With the exception of a couple of managers, the servers are all hearing impaired. Don't let this be a cause for concern, though - their service and attention to your dining needs make many other restaurant servers pale in comparison."

He then took me upstairs and regularly checked to make sure everything was ok. I didn't eat so can,t comment on food but had a lemon honey tea which was delicious.

One of their waitresses took our order. I had the delicious spicy momos and my friend had the fish steak, which according to him was also good. Having read the other reviews, I guess it's just ordering the right stuff to notch things up. Place is clean at the time we visited and service is quite ok (perhaps we were not too demanding).

The slippers in the bathroom were really oily and dusgusting.  Also, I asked before I came whether the girl giving the massage was experienced with sports injuries and was told that she was. However, she was a student and had only been giving massages for 1 year. She was really sweet and I did feel she did a good job of what she was trained to do, though, and to be fair, it definitely helped, so I can't complain on that level. However, some things she said gave me a strong impression that their training could be more complete. It was surprising that she had trouble understanding that I needed a wet towel to wipe down in order to avoid getting my clothes oily.  But it's a great initiative and I hope they keep expanding."

The place is in a nice neighbourhood and it's quite and clean, isolated from the noise and dust of the city.

I can say without doubt that it was one of the best massage's I've ever had. It was more than a massage really. I feel like Ramji worked on deep core issues to treat the cause instead of the symptoms. I was really blown away at the quality of his work and his skill. He is highly trained and has a natural touch for figuring out structural issues. I will be going back soon for a follow up, not on his suggestion, but because I thought it was that amazing. Really top notch. Ramji is also just a good guy. The facilities are also very clean and the price is incredibly fair. I can't recommend Seeing Hands, and Ramji, enough. Check out the Patan location! It is less busy and a nice, quiet neighborhood."

I had a 90minute sports remedial massage - the first massage I've ever had that actually felt like it was doing something seriously good to my muscles and body! Ramji was so perceptive and talented.

I chose the Swedish massage for 90 minutes and it was great at un-knotting my back and shoulders. Ramji was careful to adjust the strength of the massage to the right level to combine power and relaxation. The place is clean and, for me, a good point is they don’t bother with the dolphin sounds or ethereal music. Instead we had an interesting chat.  Seeing Hands seems to have a nice model of formally training masseurs with proper skills and then opening up new clinics to employ them in.  The setting for the Patan clinic is peaceful on the top floor of a house set back from the road. The entrance is next to a Toyota showroom and there are some signs along the road.  It’s probably best to phone in advance to make an appointment."

Seeing Hands was located just down the street from where I was living. I would regularly see the female therapist Lalu who was able to help me a lot. I began to think of her as my 'back doctor!' Lulu really understood what was required to ease the tension in my back. She always checked in with me about pressure (however, I found the pressure she used for the massage to always be just right). Plus she has an excellent personality and I really enjoyed chatting with her before and after the massage.  The facilities are great. Very clean and always kept warm. The massage rooms are located on the top floor of the building up several flights of stairs, meaning accessing rooms might be difficult for some. I never called to make an appointment, so I don't know what that is like. I would often just pop by and either be seen right away, or make an appointment for later in the day when Lalu had availability. I don't remember the exact price for a 60 or 90 minute massage, but I do know the prices are very reasonable (15-25 USD range). They had a stamp card system, where your 10th massage is free. Although I tried, I was only able to fill one card before having to leave Nepal.  I'll be returning to Nepal in a few months and will definitely be back to the Lalitpur branch of Seeing Hands."

We came here to visit and see just what was left, and also to make a side trip to the nearby Karyabnayak Temple as-well. The feeling of being the only two visitors to the large open square, Villagers herding their ducks and goats through the old temple grounds actually added to the experience. I have always been a big archeology fan, so ruins excite me. These are relatively new, caused by a natural disaster, not time, although the original temples were in the 6-700 year old range. Visiting here is more of an exploration into the past. If a bunch of broken stones doesn't excite you much, I would skip this site. There's a lot of history , hundreds of small temples in the Kathmandu valley to explore. Most of the old shops and restaurants are gone, there is still one wood carver left here, turning out some beautiful HIndu and Bhuddist Statuary out of ancient pieces of wood that he imports from the Langtang region of Nepal. Worth the trip just to visit his shop."

The oldest Newari document of Kathmandu valley was found in the treasury of this monastery; the palm-leaf document dates back to early 12th century. The full-body statue of Shiva Dev, a Licchchavi king of ancient Nepal, now appears as a Rana military general providing a keen insight into how ruling classes appropriate norms and public works to serve their interest. This monastery is also a living heritage of rituals which take place in several occasions throughout the year. The monastery complex has stunning brass artwork throughout its premises. Highly recommended. Non-Nepali visitors pay NPR 30-50 for access to this monastery."

The nice view of Durbar Square was the only good thing about it and you can get that from other nearby restaurants. I had Newari set meal which was inedible at best and the only reason why it didn't make me sick was that I couldn't finish it. The soup was sour like it has gone bad. From the main course I ate white beans which were very plain, potatoes which had no taste and were cold and pancake which was very crumbly and dry. I couldn't stomach the rest of the food. I attempted to eat small round black beans but almost broke my teeth. Even though I was the only customer, it took them ages to come and clean my table. I ended up giving up on waiting and went to pay my bill at their reception area."

Though we ate out a lot, there is a clean and well equipped kitchen upstairs. The staff are both warm and professional.

Manoj, Abhi and Raaz were always available to answer questions and to help us. By the end of our stay I was very sad to leave such special people and a place that housed us so well.

My wife and I have lived in Kathmandu for a little over a year now and when I decided to take off a recent Friday to make a long weekend, I was certain the October weather would be fine. I was wrong. The monsoon, that a few days before seemed to have dissipated, was back. A steady rain settled in making our planned excursion to the Kopan Monastery problematic. When the veil of rain still hadn’t lifted by 11:30 Saturday morning, we scrubbed our plans and headed to lunch.  We visited GG Machaan several months ago and I remembered it as having a pleasant, covered outdoor terrace which made it a good candidate for lunch on a rainy day. We arrived at 12:15 after a short drive and were immediately seated. My memory was correct. The two level outdoor terrace is bamboo covered and sports photos of Nepali royalty hunting for big game in times long past. The menu contains predominantly Nepali snacks but also a mix of western fare and Indian food.  After a brief perusal of the menu, we settled on Perale mushrooms (oyster mushrooms battered w/Benal gram flower, green chili, garlic) and the GG fried Basa fish. The waiter capably took our order and read everything back to make sure he had it correct. While we waited for our order to arrive, I tapped my foot to cover versions of popular tunes played in the background. After a reasonable wait, the mushrooms arrived. What was immediately noticeable to us was that the chef had clearly considered the presentation of this simple dish. In most restaurants around town, food is unceremoniously dumped on the plate. Here, the main dish was carefully plated and garnished with carved vegetables. Nice! The taste was as good as the presentation.  No sooner had we polished off the mushrooms than the fish arrived. The presentation of golden-fried chunks of Basa fish equaled that of the now disappeared mushrooms. The Basa fish soon suffered the same fate. As we lingered on the quiet terrace enjoying a rainy afternoon it was clear to us that we had chosen wisely.  While GG Machaan is no jungle, it is a place for good food, well presented in comfortable surroundings."

A plate of grilled prawn was enough for us, not quantity wise though, as the portion was really small. The accompanying salad seemed like something they prepared for their goats and as an afer thought putit on our plate. The only saving grace was their special salad which was quite good and the portion good.  The live band was good with english songs but it was irritating to hear them trash the Nepali classics with hangover of their english songs, their accent to be precise.

(Ask for gu","We recently returned to the US from the trip of a lifetime in Nepal, organized by Trekking Guide Team Adventure. We started with the Everest Base Camp trek, traveled to Chitwan, then spent a few days in Pokhara. Kabi, the owner and organizer, couldn't have been more professional. He always listened to our wants and needs and always made them happen. He was extremely flexible even when we wanted to change details of our trip on the spot. For example, when going to Chitwan we originally were going to take a tourist bus. We decided we'd rather go by private car(i highly recommend) Kabi arranged us a car and a driver for the entire journey. I can't say enough great things about Kabis professionalism, flexibility, and genuine desire to make our adventure perfect. He succeeded!! Our guide for EBC was Shambu Basnet. This man was one of the main reasons our trip was so enjoyable and successful. He took on several roles on top of being our guide. He arranged for excellent lodging along the trek, made sure our food was wonderful, checked our vitals at high altitude, if we were struggling he was right there to help. He was extremely well knowledgeable and informative regarding the trek, the mountains, the wildlife, and the people and different cultures of Nepal. If you need a guide, you can't do any better than Shambu. I'd trust my life to him any day. He made sure our safety was a number one concern. We were so impressed by Shambu we asked him to join us as our guide after the trek to Chitwan and Pokhara. He graciously accepted and obliged and we are glad he did. Not one part of this trip would have been as enjoyable or educational without Shambu. He too was flexible, if we needed anything...Shambu always went above and beyond to make it happen! We may have started as client and guide but now, thankfully we leave friends forever!!! If you're looking for a trekking or travel agency to help with your trip to Nepal, look no further than Kabi and Trekking Guide Team Adventure. They have a myriad of treks, excursions, and experiences for you to choose from. You won't be disappointed. Kabi, Shambu, and all of the staff at Trekking Guide Team Adventure take customer service to another level. If you're in need of a guide, request Shambu Basnet. Again, you won't be disappointed."

Kabi is organiser was able to fit our requirements very well. We had a tight schedule but the dates were able to line up perfectly! The guide Shambu made the trip 1000 times better. He is extremely knowledgeable and was able to answer all our questions about the history and culture of the mountains. He was very friendly and well connected with the locals meaning he was able to get us rooms when others were sleeping in tents outside. He also knew airport staff and made sure we were able to get higher priority on flights. His priority is always his guests and made sure to always check if we were comfortable. Shambu is the best possible guide you can get and make sure you ask for him when you do this trek!

We found the company (TGTA) to be very professional and experienced and answered all of our questions promptly before setting off. Our main guide Kris has decades of guiding experience and was able to determine the level of attention and care required for each of the 10 trekkers in our group. The trek is arduous and does require a certain level of stamina and fitness to achieve the end goal. We did very limited pre-trek training and would have benefitted from a few weeks or months in the gym (squats and leg strengthening would have been most helpful), nevertheless we endured and conquered. We thoroughly recommend Karbi, Krishna, and the wonderful porters who helped to make our trip enjoyable and memorable. We should also acknowledge the wonderful Nepalese people who are trustworthy, friendly and helpful and reliant on the tourist dollar for their survival. Keep up the good work guys, we hope we can return to your beautiful country someday soon. Best Regards Stuart and Jacque."

Shambu has a bank of knowledge about Nepal, from its mountains to its flora and fauna. He taught me some key Nepalise phrases and some traditional card games.  The accommodation was clean and of a high standard. The owners of the tea houses being very kind and welcoming.

You will not be the same after you hike in the majesty of these mountains!,"I traveled in May 2018 with two of my girlfriends to Nepal to do the 16 Day Everest Base Camp trek which we booked with Kabi of Trekking Guide Team Adventure. The service that was provided by this company was Superior! We were met at the airport in Kathmandu, and our transfer to the hotel Thamel with our luggage was very easy. Mr. Kabi came and met us personally, and introduced us to our trekking guide Ram. Ram is a very quality person, and obviously has a passion for his job as a guide. He was patient and caring with 3 women who were complete newbies to the whole trekking experience! He even tried to teach us some Nepalese, although we did not prove to be very good students. Ram was cheerful at all times, and greeted us always with a smile and attended to every detail and need we had during our trek.  We needed to make some changes in our itinerary while we were on the trek, and both Ram and Mr. Kabi worked together to make sure everything worked out for us. They are very concerned with safety, which was a good feeling for 3 women on this adventure.  The Tea Houses we stayed in were certainly adequate, and the food was nourishing and tasted good.  The only thing I would advise is that the trek itself is not as moderate a hike as made out to be. It is very steep a lot of the time, and you are going up stone stairs! I would recommend training yourself for some endurance before you go! Coming down the mountain is just as hard as going up! Be prepared for flight delays in Lukla, and the possibility of needing to take a helicopter out of there as we did if your travel is near to Monsoon season."

After researching for the best and local trekking company in Kathmandu, Nepal I came across to Nepal Hiking Adventure. I found them were very honest, kind and helpful. I came to Nepal alone but there was a person from the agency who dropped me to my hotel. Later, he took me to his office and I came to know he was my guide for my trip to Everest Base Camp trek. This am a solo travelers but I was requested for group join trek for EBC, NHA has prepared a small group of people from different world, it was a great to meet different people for the trek. We had a small meeting with Bishnu, the managing director and Ram our tour guide. Bishnu brief everything regarding the trip. After that, Ram suggest me best cafes and restaurants nearby my hotel for tasting authentic Nepalese cuisine. Since, I visited Nepal alone they introduce me to wonderful groups of people around as well. Trekking with them was just amazing. We all were visiting Nepal for the first time as well as trekking in Everest but our tour guides and porters make this trip easy, fun, exciting and very memorable. I was truly amazed by our porters Chiring and Lakpa, they were carrying heavy loads of bags on a steep rough pathway whereas we were getting breathless even we were carrying a light backpack.  Throughout the trek, we talk about our personal life stories and learn a lot things about this region. The views from Everest Base camp and Kala Patthar is beyond any imagination which gives you the feelings that Heaven exists in the form of Himalayas. A big thank you to our guide, porters and other Nepal Hiking Adventure team for making my journey everlasting. I will never forget this adventurous journey I took with an amazing group of people. I suggest people to take physical and mental training before starting this trek as it can be very helpful while trekking long distance. I can’t forget this especially at last I would recommend Nepal Hiking Adventure to those who wants best services as this company truly offers high quality services."

Since we first meet to Bishnu and his team we feel that we are in the right place with right person to organize our tour. The guide Prasant was very professional and informative about everything. He make our day tour is very enjoyable and memorable. Definitely we recommend NHA without any hesitation. If you prefer to book any trip with NHA just go ahead you won’t regret.

A prompt detailed email reply from Bishnu (Managing Director) told us that this was the company to go with. After further email exchanges we booked on to a tour and never looked back.  In Kathmandu we were met at the airport by our guide and later we were met by Bishnu in our hotel. He checked our gear and told us what we did and didn't need.  The tour itself was excellent. Zore was a fantastic guide and pointed out all the interesting viewpoints along the way. You see some stunning scenery along the walk. Each day you walk for 4-6 hours over hilly terrain. Some bits are a slog; some bits are thoroughly enjoyable.  Each day you have three meals provided, which are very tasty and very filling! The biggest surprise to us was the accommodation. Each night we stayed in a small hotel and there is the facility to charge your devices, have a hot shower and get wifi. These do have a small cost to them and get more expensive as you go further up the mountain.  We also spent quite a lot on drinks as these are not included in the price. An extra £200 for all of the above should cover you for the duration of the trek. Water is available at every stop but you will need purification tablets to clean the water. This might sound unappealing but it really is fine.  One thing to be mindful of, if you go in the off-season, you might get stuck in Lukla. At the end of a long trek, stinking in your clothes, you 'll want to get out of Lukla and back to the 'comforts' of Kathmandu. We had to charter a helicopter which set us back another $700 but Bishnu did return us the cost of the flight as this was cancelled. This is your choice as the flights are often cancelled during this time of year. There was a guy in our hotel cabin who had been there EIGHT days waiting for a flight. Didn't quite fancy that...  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the trip and Bishnu helped to make it as simple and easy as possible. He provided us with a letter to send off to our insurance company too because of the cancelled flight.  Thank you Bishnu and NHAC!"

After this I spoke to Kamal and said please do not speak about M like this. He said ""actually yes I should focus on him and not you as you've already come back"", I said ""no you need to treat us equally"". However from this time onwards the entire focus was on M, to the point of isolating me out of the group - I was the inconvenient woman on the boys trip  Itinerary After loosing the first porter to illness Kamal was forced to carry all the bags (~37kg) on his own for a day - we said we would provide feedback to the company that he should be compensated. We were told that the problem was caused by us choosing to walk from Salleri - we said we followed Bishnu's advice and we cannot be held responsible for the fact that porters can't be found at Salleri.  Later in Gokio I was told there was not enough time to climb Gokio Ri in the itinerary because not enough time had been left to return to Lukla & because I was too slow - why did Bishnu create an itinerary that was not achievable I asked Kamal - he said again it was because we choose to walk from Salleri - do you think anyone could give some sensible advice from this company on what to do on a planning a trek? As for being too slow Chola Pass - Kamal's estimate 10-12hrs - my time 8.5hr; Crossing Gokyo glacier Kamal's estimate 3-4hrs - my time 2.5hrs. I could continue but the reality was being a boring woman I didn't stand a chance of arguing this.  Baggage Kamal had told us in Kathmandu on the morning of departure our bags could not be more than 15kg/person. We borrowed the hotel scales and ensured we met this regulation. The new porter (Kishore) was told by Kamal that the bags were between 26-28kg combined. Kishore complained within a day that the bags were too heavy. Kamal asked us to remove our items from the bags to reduce the weight. We said we were told 15kg in Kathmandu by himself and it's not our fault that he had told the porter a lower number and if he needed to pay more to the porter that was his issue to resolve not ours. We certainly couldn't be expected to throw our personal effects away. On the Chola Pass Kishore had less than 15kg to carry and offered to carry my backpack - taking his load to 20kg. After 10min he dropped my bags and again complained about the weight -  Roles We observed Kamal calling the porters ""Assistant Guide"" and asking them to do tasks of a guide - we provided feedback to the company that you cannot call someone by a higher title than they are being paid  Drinking The first of several drunken episodes with Kamal - he informed us that he was a very busy man in Kathmandu and had cancelled his training to take our tour. We were told this multiple times and our response was consistently - if you weren't free you should have told Bishnu because we did not specify who should guide us. Upon returning to Kathmandu we checked with the company on this and were told he had confirmed he was free to take the trip. I asked Ram was this to get a better tip? - and he laughed. We never mentioned tips or that there would not be a tip. Where the need to be manipulative and deceitful came from is a complete shock.  Kamal was drunk on a number of evenings. He was more focussed on playing cards, expressing how boring the trip was for him, telling clients to go to bed early (in retrospect that seemed odd to be sent to bed soon after dinner) and commenting on Japanese women. It is not the clients job to entertain the guide and to be continuously told how bored he was - offensive is all that can be said. The height of his issues with alcohol was at Gokyo - the eve of climbing Gokyo Ri I was trying to express I was scared, I could not breath and had not slept. He was so drunk he said to another tourist that Choyong was the highest mountain in the world. He could not be reasoned with nor could he help with the issues I faced. The owners of the Fitzroy Inn (excellent and worth the extra $) also confirmed he had been drinking all afternoon. On communicating this to Bishnu he said he had no idea where this behaviour had come from. Back in Kathmandu speaking to Ram he admitted the company was aware of previous issues. How an organisation can know such information, pretend they don't know and endanger people's lives at altitude is beyond comprehension.  Harassment ""Chinese Food, Italian Suit, American Life, Japanese Wife"" - ""Japanese girls eh eh eh??"" I expressed disappointment at Kamal speaking about women in this way. This continued throughout the trip and was even said to a Japanese woman’s face. I understand in this culture similar to my Indian culture - women are not valued. However, when you have international clients where #metoo #timesup is at its height – time to educate yourself Bishnu - it is never acceptable for your staff to speak about women in this way.  The night before reaching Lukla a drunk Kamal and sober Kishore ganged up on me at dinner and said ""tomorrow is the last day and porter wants you to know that you have to give a tip. Of course it's your choice but really you have to give a tip."" Next morning I told Kamal I have never been spoken to in that way and Kamal said it was his first time a porter has behaved in this way. I responded ""it's not however your first time for getting drunk"". At Lukla both were told there would be no tip - if I was white or a man no one would dare to speak to me in this way nor would they dare to speak to me drunk. I had to lock myself in my room in Lukla. Bushnu did intervene and I did appreciate that however what he said was that we could discuss everything in Kathmandu, knowing full well he would not be in Kathmandu.  Customer Service Imn fact at the same time he was sitting with my friend (who had evacuated out) at dinner saying he was leaving the next morning to (“check accommodations for upcoming groups of about 20 pax“) as it was almost 2 years since he'd been on the mountain. How can you be in this business and not visit at least yearly? On return to Kathmandu Ram was sent (Bishnu did not admit he was not in Kathmandu or even apologise for not being present until I complained that “clearly as I wouldnt be returning as a client he sees no need to face me and hear any of this”) Ram's response was you've been through a terrible experience and I would have reacted like you to the demand for a tip but please don't put any of this on TripAdvisor. Really? I don't think that it is any organisations gift to ask for. Especially if they do not offer any kind of compensation until challenged and then it's a series of complaints that Kamal did his job by bringing me back to Kathmandu and just because the porter wants a tip and the guide is drunk I want to ruin Bishnu’s company. Seriously I have better things to do and it is irrelevant to me what actions you have taken against the guide – feedback good or bad needs to be accepted particularly if you do not have do not have have the decency to stick around to hear the feedback ."

Upon arrival, we met our guide Ram, who is the reason we made it all the way up to Base Camp and back down safely! We stayed in tea houses that were much nicer than we ever imagined, and the food at all these places was great! We did not know what kind of quality to expect in the mountains, but Nepal Hiking Adventure Company took good care of us. We had to helicopter down a couple days early due to AMS, and they accommodated us by giving us a city tour while we were still in Kathmandu. I would HIGHLY recommend this company to anyone wishing to see Nepal and the surrounding mountains! It's safe, reliable, and fun! :)"
