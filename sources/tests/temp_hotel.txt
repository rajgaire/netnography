Aside from staying in a beautiful and ancient architectural building, the staff are the warmest and most accommodating. The Inn is very clean and the rooms are so unique. Despite the Winter cold, the owner insured that the room remained warm by placing an electric heater in it along with an electric blanket. I love the Inn Patan and will hopefully return again some day."

The staff and Inn are both wonderful. They greeted us weary from 24 hours of travel with hot tea and a visit to get to know one another. Each day the staff took care of us. For a mom traveling with a teenage daughter to a new country, they were more than helpful. They communicated well in advance of the trip and answered any questions I had. We were just a block away from the Patan Durbar Square and Patan Museum. I would highly recommend the Inn Patan to anyone who wants to stay in Kathmandu."

Location. Breakfast was only OK.,"We decided to book a stay at The Inn Patan since we were interested in having a more local experience and we wanted a hotel close to Durbar Square in Patan. Not up to western standards but clean, comfortable rooms. Breakfast was only OK - actually western food staples like eggs, toast, orange juice was served. Major problems with outlets to charge our devices."
