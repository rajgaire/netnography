This was the palace of the Malla kings of Patan, originally built in 1734 AD by displacing Ha Bāhā, though it has been rebuilt several times since (it was leveled in the massive 1934 AD earthquake, for example). The collection continues to expand, too, as (sadly) other historic structures of Patan are rebuilt without preserving their centuries-old carvings but at least letting the museum display them. There are occasional dances and musical events in the courtyard, and the impressively re-established annual Tantric-inspired Kartik Naach is performed in the fall outside the museum. Guide not necessary but many people apparently miss the second, separate entrance and even fewer visit the pond behind the palace."

The Sun Dhoka was topped by a beautiful , golden pediment . At the apex of the pediment was a huge Kirtimukha holding his two long fangs with his two hands coming out through his majestic mane . Below the Kirtimukh was the family of Lord Panchmukhi Shiv with his console Parvati and sons Ganesh and Skand . This family was flanked by Makar torana , ( floral-reptile motifs )with two celestial makars depicted as one third terrestrial animal ( trunk of elephant ) in the frontal part , one third aquatic animal ( crocodile ) in the middle part , one third bird ( tail of peacock ) in the hind portion with extended floral tail .  There was a golden window above the Dhoka ( gate ) , once used by the king to make public appearances .The window enshrined Avlokiteshwara aka Karunamaya ( now known all over the world as Machchhendranath , a famous Hindu yogi ) surrounded by the pantheon of Hindu gods .  The old museum building was reinforced with concealed RCC beams & slabs and retrofitted with moisture resistant membranes to protect the walls and roof from dampness .  We first witnessed Shilapatras inscripted from 659 Ad to 1896 AD . Then we climbed new stair case in the eastern wing .  There we saw a ritual oil lamp with bronze donor figure made at Bhaktapur in 1870 AD and placed under terracotta nitche and torana .  Then we saw five Buddhist beautiful figurines showcased together :  The left hand side bottom most figure was of Chamunda / Kali / Mahalaxmi . It was made of Brass in 18th - 19th century in Nepal . Depicted as a skeletal crone as no other Goddess was , the fierce Mahalaxmi - also called Chamunda / Kali - could not be mistaken for any other female deity .  The left hand side top most figure was of Indra . It was made of Gilt copper in 17th - 18th century in Nepal . Indra , an ancient Hindu God reverred by all Nepalese was recognised by his horizontal third eye , in contrast to the vertical third eye of other deities . The right hand side bottom most figure was of Vajradaka . It was made of Bronze in 17th - 18th century in Nepal . The upturned face with gaping mouth identified Vajradaka , an earth spirit who devours ill influences . Tibetans sometime took medicine through his mouth .  The right hand side top most figure was of Yam . It was made of Bronze in 17th - 18th century in Nepal . Yam , a fierce Buddhist protector , "" King of Religious Law "" , and the personification of death was unmistakable because of his bull head and mount , the water buffalo , a combination shared with no other deity .  At the centre was White Tara of the Seven Eyes . This idol was made of Cold gold , Copper alloy , Gilt , Paint and Semi precius stones in 18th - 19th century in Tibet . This form of the Buddhist Goddess Tara was reognised by her five extra eyes , one on the forehead andtwo each on the palms and soles .  The tantric images of Buddhism , the deities are in sexual embrace . We appreciated two such images :  One such image of Yam and His Consort .This idol is made of Cold gold , Copper alloy , Gilt , Paint and Semi precious stones in 15th century in Tibet . Yam , "" Lord of Death "" and "" King of the Law "" united with his consort in the vigorous pose of the fierce deities . Both wear skull studded crowns , his was a garland of severed human heads ; hers was a girdle of humane bone . They were supported by Yam's mount the water buffalo . Originally a Hindu deity , Yam was eventually incorporated into the Buddhist pantheon as a protector .  Another image was of Chakrasamvara and Vajravarahi . This idol was made of Bronze and Gilt in 18th - 19th century in Nepal . When the esoteric Bodhisattva Chakrasamvara united with his consort Vajravarahi , the "" Dimand Sow "" , they represented the union of wisdom and compassion that is the actuality of enlightenment . This extreme multiheaded and multiaremed representation was characteristic of Tantric imagery .  We also learnt the Lost Wax casting process depicted detail by various photographs having commentary .  The visit to the museum is a MUST to know the cultural richness of Nepalese civilization .  Entry Fee : Included in Patan Darbar Square Entry Fee Timings : 10:30 to 16:30 Closed : Tuesdays"

Patan is not as busy as Kathmandu so it is a good place to appreciate Nepalese architecture and style. It was also, very fortunate, to escape the massive damage of the earthquake of 2015 and while there was damage it was not as bad as Kathmandu. Spend time reading the explanations of art and explore the museum. Nowhere else in Nepal you will find such information readily available. Guides don’t know much about these treasures and will probably give you the wrong information. The entrance to the museum is included in the ticket for the entire complex."

The Royal Palace pretty much dominates the area in its granduer; the 16th C stone Krishna Mandira with 21 pinnacles dedicated the Lord Krishna does hold its own. But there's more: the Golden Temple and the terra cotta temple of Mahabouddha. By this time we were pretty much exhausted after three weeks of none stop travel.

You pay Rs 1000, which is quite a big amount, but the proceeds go to the rehabilitation of the place. I appreciated that when I went to the Patan Museum and learned about the history of the Durbar Square, the rehabilitation efforts that they have put into it, and the future plans for the place.  There were also a few galleries to check out that was very informative about the Hindu and Buddhist history, symbolisms, gods, goddesses, and beliefs.

It is about 40 minutes from central Kathmandu and there is an entrance fee to the main area. Patan is in Lalitpur district which is said to have been founded in the third century BC by the Kirat dynasty and later expanded by Licchavis in the 6th century. It was expanded further by the Mallas during the medieval period. Patan Durbar Square is listed by UNESCO as one of seven Monument Zones that make up the Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Site. Some Patan monuments were badly damaged in the 2015 earthquakes and work is continuing on rebuilding. But the Museum is outstanding and well worth a visit with excellent displays giving the history of Nepal. There are magnificent displays and the signage is in both English and Nepali. Lalitpur has the highest number of renowned artists and finest craftsmen ever recorded in the history of Nepali art. You can only marvel at the intricate wood and metal work as you move through the museum and admire the workmanship of the craftspeople. After visiting the Museum make sure you walk down the road to the Golden Temple - it was spared by the quakes. You can easily spend half a day at Patan and there are many cafes for lunch or tea. Well worth a visit and the entrance fee.

It is a UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites. The Patan Museum was inaugurated in 1997 by Late King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah. The Patan Museum displays the traditional sacred art of Nepal in an illustrious architectural setting. Its home is an old residential court of Patan Darbar, one of the royal palaces of the former Malla kings of the Kathmandu Valley. Its gilded door and window face one of the most beautiful squares in the world. The residential palace compound of Keshav Narayan Chowk which houses the museum dates from 1734, displacing a Buddhist monastery that is still remembered in an annual public rite on the palace doorstep. But both monastery and palace rest on far older foundations that may go back to the Licchavi Period (ca. 3rd to 9th century). The garden to the rear of the museum has been adapted to incorporate a pleasant resting place and The Patan Museum Cafe run by the Summit Hotel, Kathmandu."

Most objects are fine metalwork depictions of deities, and insights into the metalwork craft - for which Patan was once famous. Photos can be taken inside.  If you decide to finish your tour at the museum, there is a nice cafe at the back courtyard where you can have a drink and relax. Entry to the museum is now covered by the Patan Tourist Entrance Pass, which you can purchase at Patan Durbar square."

This is an excellently laid out museum on several floors using the structure of the original traditional building. The artefacts are sympathetically displayed with very good labelling, as are the temporary exhibitions too. The main galleries in this once royal palace, once monastery, follow and explain the the origins, development and symbolism of Hinduism and Buddhism. Other galleries show exhibits which explain the metal technology involved in creating many Buddhist and Hindu effigies. In addition, at the moment (November 2016) and temporarily there are two excellent photographic exhibitions. One contains pictures of an annual traditional Hindu ceremony covering the last thirty years. The other, more powerful, exhibition shows in visual form the struggles of the Dalit people (the so-called 'Untouchables') to gain respect and civil rights. This is a lovely museum but if museums don't have much appeal per se, it is still worth visiting just to see the building itself which is exceptionally fine for its architecture and intricate wooden carvings, or to sit in the tranquil garden and have something to eat or drink at the cafe there."

I found this place a quiet venue to understand and view together at a glance both religions’ features and contributions to the history of this Country (and not only); a contribution to mutual understanding as well, especially in the view of the fact that Buddhism has basically left India (and in Nepal too it is far behind Hinduism in terms of followers, and it is mostly alive thank to Tibetan influence)."

At Patan Museum all of the information is in English and is very detailed. The museum focuses on the history of Hinduism and Buddhism in Patan and has lots of interesting statues. There is two parts to the museum both included in the ticket price of 400 rupees. While the main museum through the golden door is intact the second half through a neighbouring door off the main square has had some damage from the earthquake but this doesn't seem to have had much in it anyway. Definitely make a visit here.  Tip: I paid 1000 rupees for a guide as I wandered into patan square, and apart from showing me where the golden temple is he wasn't worth the price (though he was a nice person). Definitely don't get a guide for the museum as I saw one person being shown round quickly by the guide and he didn't see much of the exhibits. Do it at your own speed."

You may enter the square for free and there's a eating area at the back but to enter the actual museum has a fee. (500 or 400nr...) the display of bronzed Gods in different postures from different times is splendid. I especially like the cushioned-window-sitting nooks where you can get closer to the wood carvings and gaze at the people below."

The museum building itself is breathtaking, but you can see that this has all been planned and implemented to a very high standard. All the exhibits are well presented and the level of detail they have gone to in order to explain each exhibit and the religious significance of them is done so in an easy to understand manner. Particularly when you consider that the subject matter of Hindu and Buddhist gods is not the easiest of subjects for the uninitiated to understand.  The entrance fee is very good value and there is an excellent cafe within the main courtyard of the museum. Incidentally you can access the cafe for free from the main entrance off Durbar Square."

Hindu and Buddhist art is complicated, layered, and confusing to outside observers. The Patan Museum does a wonderful job of illuminating and clarifying the art and culture that visitors will see around themselves everywhere in Nepal."
