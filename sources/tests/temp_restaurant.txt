Great hospitality and great environment. I totally love this cafe but when we went there it was already raining so didn't enjoy much. But this place looks amazing when it's sunny and I would definitely recommend others to visit there when it's sunny outside .

It is an excellent and peaceful location The server gestured vaguely towards some tables where we might sit, only to later inform us that the one we selected was 'reserved'. Just as other reviewers have noted, the reservers never showed up! My suggestion for improvement would be that, if tables are important enough to be reserved, it's worth the server making the effort to show guests to a table that they can in fact sit at.  Orders were taken quickly and delivered reasonably quickly, but were marked by small inconsistencies. The pot of tea was (commendably) brewed from loose leaf tea, but we had to remind the café that we would need a strainer for this, and it turned out to be very bland tea. Coffee was pretty normal, although it was not delivered at a temperature much more than lukewarm. Similarly, apple pie arrived reasonably quickly, but, on inspection, was found to be cold. The café rectified this with good grace though.  Overall, this is an acceptable café, especially given the chaotic streets surrounding it, but we didn't find it 'very good' or 'excellent', and there is little evidence of them making much effort."

The cafe is inside the Royal Palace and it is very interesting to find a modern garden setting in the middle of everything that's of Newari architecture.  The cafe is operated by the Summit Hotel so the service is expectedly very ""hotelish"" -- white napkins, well-dressed waiters, etc. It's not a complaint though but I've always liked to dine in places where it's more local and authentic. Nevertheless, the cafe is a very welcome break from all the walking around temples and red-brick houses. I loved that it was quiet and peaceful and of course, service was very prompt and very attentive.  There was very good food presentation, expectedly again! But I wouldn't say it's extraordinary.

It is probably not possible to find a more peaceful place anywhere around. The Museum Cafe which is run by the Patan Summit Hotel is overpriced and the food is boring. The waiters do their job, nothing else. Don't expect any flexibility (kid's portions etc), they know they are at the most beautiful place of town with tourists coming anyway...  Do visit the museum which is superb and take a stroll through the little garden next to the restaurant - there is plenty of romantic places to relax and eat your packed lunch... You can visit the garden without having to buy a museum ticket, it's fully public."

Stick to something simple and you will enjoy your lunch."

We learned a lot studying its exhibits. And the perfect way to conclude our visit was to stop for lunch in the charming Museum Cafe. The food was acceptably tasty and service was quite good, but it's the patio ambience that makes this cafe so special. Tour groups arrive for buffet lunches to I'd expect it to get a little crowded in the high season."
