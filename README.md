# Roshis's Netnography Project
This repository is a part of Roshis's PhD research. 
The aim of this research is to understand authenticity in the context of tourism.

Authenticity means different things to different peoples, particularly in the context of indegeneious tourism.
E.g. tourist may be looking for as an authentic experience, however the tourism operators might think it as something else.

This repository is to look for tourists' online review of places, things and experiences to understand what they think about authenticity. 
This online review will be followed by workshoping with tourism operators to understand the gaps between their understandings and finding the ways to filling the gaps.

The repository is structured as follows:
- Keywords - contains keywords related to object, constructive and existential authenticities.
- Sources - source codes for extracting reviews from different sources and processing the data to extract reviews related to authenticities.
